MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

INTRODUCTION

One day, my students sat me down and ordered me
to write this book. They wanted people to be able to
use our work to make their lives better. It was some-
thing I'd wanted to do for along time, but it became
my number one priority.

My work is part of a tradition in psychology that
shows the power of people's beliefs. These may be be-
liefs we're aware of or unaware of, but they strongly
affect what we want and whether we succeed in
getting it. This tradition also shows how changing
people's beliefs—even the simplest beliefs—can have
profound effects.

In this book, you'll learn how a simple belief about
yourself—a belief we discovered in our research—
guides a large part of your life. In fact, it permeates
every part of your life. Much of what you think of as

your personality actually grows out of this “mind-
set.” Much of what may be preventing you from ful-
filling your potential grows out of it.

No book has ever explained this mindset and
shown people how to make use of it in their lives.
You'll suddenly understand the greats—in the sci-
ences and arts, in sports, and in business—and
the would-have-beens. You'll understand your mate,
your boss, your friends, your kids. You'll see how to
unleash your potential—and your children’s.

It is my privilege to share my findings with you.
Besides accounts of people from my research, I’ve
filled each chapter with stories both ripped from the
headlines and based on my own life and experience,
so you can see the mindsets in action. (In most cases,
names and personal information have been changed
to preserve anonymity; in some cases, several people
have been condensed into one to make a clearer
point. A number of the exchanges are re-created
from memory, and I have rendered them to the best
of my ability.)

At the end of each chapter and throughout the last
chapter, I show you ways to apply the lessons—ways
to recognize the mindset that is guiding your life,

to understand how it works, and to change it if you
wish.

Alittle note about grammar. I know it and I love it,
but I haven't always followed it in this book. I start
sentences with ands and buts. I end sentences with
prepositions. I use the plural they in contexts that
require the singular he or she. I've done this for infor-
mality and immediacy, and I hope that the sticklers
will forgive me.

A little note on this updated edition. I felt it was
important to add new information to some of the
chapters. I added our new study on organizational
mindsets to chapter 5 (Business). Yes, a whole or-
ganization can have a mindset! I added a new sec-
tion on “false growth mindset” to chapter 7 (Par-
ents, Teachers, and Coaches) after I learned about
the many creative ways people were interpreting
and implementing the growth mindset, not always
accurately. And I added “The Journey to a (True)
Growth Mindset” to chapter 8 (Changing Mindsets)
because many people have asked for more informa-
tion on how to take that journey. I hope these up-
dates are helpful.

I'd like to take this chance to thank all of the people
who made my research and this book possible. My
students have made my research career a complete
joy. hope they’ve learned as much from me as I've
learned from them. I'd also like to thank the organ-
izations that supported our research: the William T.
Grant Foundation, the National Science Foundation,
the Department of Education, the National Institute
of Mental Health, the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development, the Spencer Foun-
dation, and the Raikes Foundation.

The people at Random House have been the most
encouraging team I could wish for: Webster Younce,
Daniel Menaker, Tom Perry, and, most of all, Caroline
Sutton and Jennifer Hershey, my editors. Your ex-
citement about my book and your great suggestions
have made all the difference. I thank my superb
agent, Giles Anderson, as well as Heidi Grant for put-
ting me in touch with him.

Thanks to all the people who gave me input and
feedback, but special thanks to Polly Shulman, Rich-

Chapter 1

THE MINDSETS

When I was a young researcher, just starting out,
something happened that changed my life. I was
obsessed with understanding how people cope with
failures, and I decided to study it by watching how
students grapple with hard problems. So I brought
children one at a time to a room in their school,
made them comfortable, and then gave them a ser-
ies of puzzles to solve. The first ones were fairly
easy, but the next ones were hard, As the students
grunted, perspired, and toiled, I watched their strat-
egies and probed what they were thinking and feel-
ing. I expected differences among children in how
they coped with the difficulty, but I saw something I
never expected.

lreste 28 mindans le chapive %


==================================================
Page 13
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

Confronted with the hard puzzles, one ten-year-old
boy pulled up his chair, rubbed his hands together,
smacked his lips, and cried out, “I love a challenge!”
Another, sweating away on these puzzles, looked up
with a pleased expression and said with authority,
“You know, I was hoping this would be informative!”

What's wrong with them? I wondered. I always
thought you coped with failure or you didn’t cope
with failure. I never thought anyone loved failure.
Were these alien children or were they on to some-
thing?

Everyone has a role model, someone who pointed
the way at a critical moment in their lives. These
children were my role models. They obviously knew
something I didn’t and I was determined to figure it
out—to understand the kind of mindset that could
tuna failure into a gift.

What did they know? They knew that human
qualities, such as intellectual skills, could be cul-
tivated. And that’s what they were doing—getting
smarter. Not only weren't they discouraged by fail-
ure, they didn’t even think they were failing. They
thought they were learning.

lreste 28 mindans le chapive %


==================================================
Page 14
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

I, on the other hand, thought human qualities
were carved in stone. You were smart or you weren't,
and failure meant you weren't. It was that simple.
If you could arrange successes and avoid failures (at
all costs), you could stay smart. Struggles, mistakes,
perseverance were just not part of this picture.

Whether human qualities are things that can be
cultivated or things that are carved in stone is an old
issue. What these beliefs mean for you is a new one:
What are the consequences of thinking that your
intelligence or personality is something you can de-
velop, as opposed to something that is a fixed, deep-
seated trait? Let’s first look in on the age-old, fiercely
waged debate about human nature and then return
to the question of what these beliefs mean for you.

WHY DO PEOPLE DIFFER?

Since the dawn of time, people have thought differ-
ently, acted differently, and fared differently from
each other. It was guaranteed that someone would
ask the question of why people differed—why some
people are smarter or more moral—and whether
there was something that made them permanently

different. Experts lined up on both sides. Some
claimed that there was a strong physical basis for
these differences, making them unavoidable and
unalterable. Through the ages, these alleged phys-
ical differences have included bumps on the skull
(phrenology), the size and shape of the skull (crani-
ology), and, today, genes.

Others pointed to the strong differences in people's
backgrounds, experiences, training, or ways of
learning. It may surprise you to know that a big
champion of this view was Alfred Binet, the inventor
of the IQ test. Wasn't the IQ test meant to summar-
ize children’s unchangeable intelligence? In fact, no.
Binet, a Frenchman working in Paris in the early
twentieth century, designed this test to identify
children who were not profiting from the Paris pub-
lic schools, so that new educational programs could be
designed to get them back on track. Without denying
individual differences in children’s intellects, he be-
lieved that education and practice could bring about
fundamental changes in intelligence. Here is a quote
from one of his major books, Modern Ideas About
Children, in which he summarizes his work with
hundreds of children with learning difficulties:

lreste25 mindans le chapive %


==================================================

==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

A few modern philosophers...assert that an
individual's intelligence is a fixed quantity,
a quantity which cannot be increased. We
must protest and react against this bru-
tal pessimism.... With practice, training, and
above all, method, we manage to increase
our attention, our memory, our judgment
and literally to become more intelligent
than we were before.

Who's right? Today most experts agree that it’s
not either-or. It’s not nature or nurture, genes or en-
vironment. From conception on, there’s a constant
give-and-take between the two. In fact, as Gilbert
Gottlieb, an eminent neuroscientist, put it, not only
do genes and environment cooperate as we develop,
but genes require input from the environment to
work properly.

‘At the same time, scientists are learning that
people have more capacity for lifelong learning
and brain development than they ever thought.
Of course, each person has a unique genetic en-
dowment. People may start with different tempera-

ments and different aptitudes, but it is clear that
experience, training, and personal effort take them
the rest of the way. Robert Sternberg, the present-
day guru of intelligence, writes that the major fac-
tor in whether people achieve expertise “is not some
fixed prior ability, but purposeful engagement.” Or,
as his forerunner Binet recognized, it’s not always
the people who start out the smartest who end up
the smartest.

WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN FOR
YOU? THE TWO MINDSETS.

It’s one thing to have pundits spouting their opin-
ions about scientific issues. It’s another thing to
understand how these views apply to you. For thirty
years, my research has shown that the view you adopt
for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your
life. it can determine whether you become the per-
‘son you want to be and whether you accomplish the
things you value. How does this happen? How can
a simple belief have the power to transform your
psychology and, as a result, your life?

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

Believing that your qualities are carved in stone—
the fixed mindset—creates an urgency to prove your-
self over and over. If you have only a certain amount
of intelligence, a certain personality, and a certain
moral character—well, then you’d better prove that
you have a healthy dose of them. It simply wouldn’t
do to look or feel deficient in these most basic char-
acteristics.

Some of us are trained in this mindset from an
early age. Even as a child, I was focused on being
smart, but the fixed mindset was really stamped in
by Mrs. Wilson, my sixth-grade teacher. Unlike Al-
fred Binet, she believed that people's IQ scores told
the whole story of who they were. We were seated
around the room in IQ order, and only the highest-IQ
students could be trusted to carry the flag, clap the
erasers, or take a note to the principal. Aside from
the daily stomachaches she provoked with her judg-
mental stance, she was creating a mindset in which
everyone in the class had one consuming goal—look
smart, don’t look dumb. Who cared about or enjoyed
learning when our whole being was at stake every
time she gave us a test or called on us in class?

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

I’ve seen so many people with this one consuming
goal of proving themselves—in the classroom, in
their careers, and in their relationships. Every situ-
ation calls for a confirmation of their intelligence,
personality, or character. Every situation is evalu-
ated: Will I succeed or fail? Will I look smart or dumb?
Will I be accepted or rejected? Will I feel like a winner or
aloser?

But doesn’t our society value intelligence, person-
ality, and character? Isn't it normal to want these
traits? Yes, but...

There’s another mindset in which these traits are
not simply a hand you're dealt and have to live with,
always trying to convince yourself and others that
you have a royal flush when you're secretly worried
it’s a pair of tens. In this mindset, the hand you're
dealt is just the starting point for development. This
growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic
qualities are things you can cultivate through your
efforts, your strategies, and help from others. Al-
though peopie may differ in every which way—in
their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or tem-
peraments—everyone can change and grow through
application and experience.

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

Do people with this mindset believe that anyone
can be anything, that anyone with proper motiv-
ation or education can become Einstein or Beet-
hoven? No, but they believe that a person's true po-
tential is unknown (and unknowable); that it’s im-
possible to foresee what can be accomplished with
years of passion, toil, and training.

Did you know that Darwin and Tolstoy were con-
sidered ordinary children? That Ben Hogan, one of
the greatest golfers of all time, was completely unco-
ordinated and graceless as a child? That the photo-
grapher Cindy Sherman, who has been on virtually
every list of the most important artists of the twen-
tieth century, failed her first photography course?
That Geraldine Page, one of our greatest actresses,
was advised to give it up for lack of talent?

You can see how the belief that cherished qual-
ities can be developed creates a passion for learning.
Why waste time proving over and over how great
you are, when you could be getting better? Why
hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them? Why
look for friends or partners who will just shore up
your self-esteem instead of ones who will also chal-
lenge you to grow? And why seek out the tried and

true, instead of experiences that will stretch you?
The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to
it, even (or especially) when it’s not going well, is the
hallmark of the growth mindset. This is the mindset
that allows people to thrive during some of the most
challenging times in their lives.

A VIEW FROM THE TWO MINDSETS:

To give you a better sense of how the two mindsets
work, imagine—as vividly as you can—that you area
young adult having a really bad day:

One day, you go to a class that is really im-
portant to you and that you like a lot. The
professor returns the midterm papers to the
class. You got a C+. You're very disappointed.
That evening on the way back to your home,
you find that you've gotten a parking ticket.
Being really frustrated, you call your best
friend to share your experience but are sort
of brushed off.

==================================================
Page 22
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

What would you think? What would you feel?
What would you do?

When Iasked people with the fixed mindset, this is
what they said: “I'd feel like a reject.” “I'm a total fail-
ure.” “I'm an idiot.” “I'm a loser.” “I'd feel worthless
and dumb—everyone’s better than me.” “I'm slime.”
In other words, they'd see what happened as a direct
measure of their competence and worth.

This is what they’d think about their lives: “My
life is pitiful.” “I have no life.” “Somebody upstairs
doesn’t like me.” “The world is out to get me.” “Some-
one is out to destroy me.” “Nobody loves me, every-
body hates me.” “Life is unfair and all efforts are
useless.” “Life stinks. I'm stupid. Nothing good ever

happens to me.” “I'm the most unlucky person on
this earth.”

Excuse me, was there death and destruction, or
just a grade, a ticket, and a bad phone call?

Are these just people with low self-esteem? Or
card-carrying pessimists? No. When they aren't cop-
ing with failure, they feel just as worthy and op-
timistic—and bright and attractive—as people with
the growth mindset.

Areste 16 min dans le chapite 3%


==================================================
Page 23
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

So how would they cope? “I wouldn't bother to
put so much time and effort into doing well in any-
thing.” (In other words, don’t let anyone measure
you again.) “Do nothing.” “Stay in bed.” “Get drunk.”
“Eat.” “Yell at someone if I get a chance to.” “Eat choc-
olate.” “Listen to music and pout.” “Go into my closet
and sit there.” “Pick a fight with somebody.” “Cry.”
“Break something.” “What is there to do?”

What is there to do! You know, when I wrote the vi-
gnette, I intentionally made the grade a C+, not an F.
It was a midterm rather than a final. It was a parking
ticket, not a car wreck. They were “sort of brushed
off,” not rejected outright. Nothing catastrophic or
irreversible happened. Yet from this raw material
the fixed mindset created the feeling of utter failure
and paralysis.

When I gave people with the growth mindset the
same vignette, here's what they said. They'd think:

“Ineed to try harder in class, be more careful when
parking the car, and wonder if my friend had a bad
day.”

“The C+ would tell me that I'd have to work a lot
harder in the class, but I have the rest of the semester
to pull up my grade.”

Areste 14 mindans le chapire 3%


==================================================
Page 24
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

There were many, many more like this, but I think
you get the idea. Now, how would they cope? Dir-
ectly.

“ld start thinking about studying harder (or study-
ing in a different way) for my next test in that class,
Td pay the ticket, and I'd work things out with my
best friend the next time we speak.”

“[’d look at what was wrong on my exam, resolve to
do better, pay my parking ticket, and call my friend
to tell her I was upset the day before.”

“Work hard on my next paper, speak to the teacher,
be more careful where I park or contest the ticket,
and find out what’s wrong with my friend.”

You don’t have to have one mindset or the other to
be upset. Who wouldn't be? Things like a poor grade
or a rebuff from a friend or loved one—these are
not fun events. No one was smacking their lips with
relish. Yet those people with the growth mindset
were not labeling themselves and throwing up their
hands. Even though they felt distressed, they were
ready to take the risks, confront the challenges, and
keep working at them.

==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

SO, WHAT'S NEW?

Is this such a novel idea? We have lots of sayings
that stress the importance of risk and the power
of persistence, such as “Nothing ventured, nothing
gained” and “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try
again” or “Rome wasn't built in a day.” (By the way,
I was delighted to learn that the Italians have the
same expression.) What is truly amazing is that
people with the fixed mindset would not agree. For
them, it’s “Nothing ventured, nothing lost.” “If at
first you don’t succeed, you probably don’t have the
ability.” “If Rome wasn’t built in a day, maybe it
wasn’t meant to be.” In other words, risk and effort
are two things that might reveal your inadequacies
and show that you were not up to the task. In fact,
it’s startling to see the degree to which people with
the fixed mindset do not believe in putting in effort
or getting help.

What's also new is that people's ideas about risk
and effort grow out of their more basic mindset.
It’s not just that some people happen to recognize
the value of challenging themselves and the import-

==================================================
Page 26
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

ance of effort. Our research has shown that this
comes directly from the growth mindset. When we
teach people the growth mindset, with its focus on
development, these ideas about challenge and effort
follow. Similarly, it’s not just that some people hap-
pen to dislike challenge and effort. When we (tem-
porarily) put people in a fixed mindset, with its focus
on permanent traits, they quickly fear challenge and
devalue effort.

We often see books with titles like The Ten Se-
crets of the World’s Most Successful People crowding
the shelves of bookstores, and these books may give
many useful tips. But they’re usually a list of uncon-
nected pointers, like “Take more risks!” or “Believe
in yourself!” While you're left admiring people who
can do that, it’s never clear how these things fit
together or how you could ever become that way.
So you're inspired for a few days, but basically the
world’s most successful people still have their se-
crets.

Instead, as you begin to understand the fixed and
growth mindsets, you will see exactly how one thing
leads to another—how a belief that your qualities
are carved in stone leads to a host of thoughts and

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

actions, and how a belief that your qualities can be
cultivated leads to a host of different thoughts and
actions, taking you down an entirely different road.
It’s what we psychologists call an Aha! experience.
Not only have I seen this in my research when we
teach people a new mindset, but I get letters all the
time from people who have read my work.

They recognize themselves: “As I read your article
literally found myself saying over and over again,
‘This is me, this is me!’” They see the connections:
“Your article completely blew me away. I felt I had
discovered the secret of the universe!” They feel their
mindsets reorienting: “I can certainly report a kind
of personal revolution happening in my own think-
ing, and this is an exciting feeling.” And they can
put this new thinking into practice for themselves
and others: “Your work has allowed me to transform
my work with children and see education through
a different lens,” or “I just wanted to let you know
what an impact—on a personal and practical level—
your outstanding research has had for hundreds of
students.” I get lots of these letters from coaches and
business leaders, too.

SELF-INSIGHT: WHO HAS ACCURATE VIEWS
OF THEIR ASSETS AND LIMITATIONS?

Well, maybe the people with the growth mindset
don’t think they’re Einstein or Beethoven, but aren’t
they more likely to have inflated views of their abil-
ities and try for things they’re not capable of? In
fact, studies show that people are terrible at estimat-
ing their abilities. Recently, we set out to see who
is most likely to do this. Sure, we found that people
greatly misestimated their performance and their
ability. But it was those with the fixed mindset who ac-
counted for almost all the inaccuracy. The people with
the growth mindset were amazingly accurate.
When you think about it, this makes sense. If, like
those with the growth mindset, you believe you can
develop yourself, then you're open to accurate in-
formation about your current abilities, even if it’s
unflattering. What's more, if you're oriented toward
learning, as they are, you need accurate information
about your current abilities in order to learn effect-
ively. However, if everything is either good news or
bad news about your precious traits—as it is with

fixed-mindset people—distortion almost inevitably
enters the picture. Some outcomes are magnified,
others are explained away, and before you know it
you don’t know yourself at all.

Howard Gardner, in his book Extraordinary Minds,
concluded that exceptional individuals have “a spe-
cial talent for identifying their own strengths and
weaknesses.” It’s interesting that those with the
growth mindset seem to have that talent.

WHAT'S IN STORE

The other thing exceptional people seem to have
is a special talent for converting life's setbacks into
future successes. Creativity researchers concur. In a
poll of 143 creativity researchers, there was wide
agreement about the number one ingredient in cre-
ative achievement. And it was exactly the kind of
perseverance and resilience produced by the growth
mindset.

You may be asking again, How can one belief lead to
all this—the love of challenge, belief in effort, resilience
in the face of setbacks, and greater (more creative!)

success? In the chapters that follow, you'll see exactly
how this happens: how the mindsets change what
people strive for and what they see as success. How
they change the definition, significance, and impact
of failure. And how they change the deepest mean-
ing of effort. You'll see how these mindsets play out
in school, in sports, in the workplace, and in rela-
tionships. You'll see where they come from and how

they can be changed.

Which mindset do you have? Answer these
questions about intelligence. Read each
statement and decide whether you mostly
agree with it or disagree with it.

1. Your intelligence is something very basic
about you that you can't change very much.
2. You can learn new things, but you can’t
really change how intelligent you are.

3. No matter how much intelligence you
have, you can always change it quite a bit.

4. You can always substantially change how
intelligent you are.

Questions 1 and 2 are the fixed-mindset
questions. Questions 3 and 4 reflect the
growth mindset. Which mindset did you
agree with more? You can be a mixture, but
most people lean toward one or the other.

You also have beliefs about other abil-
ities. You could substitute “artistic talent,”
“sports ability,” or “business skill” for “intel-
ligence.” Try it.

It’s not only your abilities; it’s your per-
sonal qualities too. Look at these statements
about personality and character and decide
whether you mostly agree or mostly dis-
agree with each one.

4. You are a certain kind of person, and
there is not much that can be done to really
change that.

2. No matter what kind of person you are,
you can always change substantially.

3. You can do things differently, but the
important parts of who you are can’t really
be changed.

4. You can always change basic things about
the kind of person you are.

Here, questions 1 and 3 are the fixed-
mindset questions and questions 2 and 4
reflect the growth mindset. Which did you
agree with more?

Did it differ from your intelligence mind-
set? It can. Your “intelligence mindset”
comes into play when situations involve
mental ability.

Your “personality mindset” comes into
play in situations that involve your per-
sonal qualities—for example, how depend-
able, cooperative, caring, or socially skilled
you are. The fixed mindset makes you con-
cerned with how you'll be judged; the
growth mindset makes you concerned with
improving.

Here are some more ways to think about
mindsets:

+ Think about someone you know
who is steeped in the fixed mindset.
Think about how they're always
trying to prove themselves and how
they’re supersensitive about being
wrong or making mistakes. Did you
ever wonder why they were this
way? (Are you this way?) Now you
can begin to understand why.

+ Think about someone you know
who is skilled in the growth mind-
set—someone who understands
that important qualities can be
cultivated. Think about the ways
they confront obstacles. Think
about the things they do to stretch
themselves. What are some ways
you might like to change or stretch
yourself?

you to the front of the room and

one after another.

Put yourself in a fixed mindset. Your
ability is on the line. Can you feel every-
‘one’s eyes on you? Can you see the in-
structor’s face evaluating you? Feel the
tension, feel your ego bristle and waver.
What else are you thinking and feeling?

Now put yourself in a growth mind-

here. You're here to learn. The teacher is
a resource for learning. Feel the tension
leave you; feel your mind open up.

The message is: You can change your
mindset.

Chapter 2

INSIDE THE MINDSETS.

When I was a young woman, I wanted a prince-like
mate. Very handsome, very successful. A big cheese.
Iwanted a glamorous career, but nothing too hard or
risky. And I wanted it all to come to me as validation
of who I was.

It would be many years before I was satisfied. I got
a great guy, but he was a work in progress. I have a
great career, but boy, is it a constant challenge. Noth-
ing was easy. So why am I satisfied? I changed my
mindset.

I changed it because of my work. One day my doc-
toral student, Mary Bandura, and I were trying to
understand why some students were so caught up
in proving their ability, while others could just let
go and learn. Suddenly we realized that there were

reste heure et 38 min danse chapitre 5%


==================================================
Page 36
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

two meanings to ability, not one: a fixed ability that
needs to be proven, and a changeable ability that can
be developed through learning.

That’s how the mindsets were born. I knew in-
stantly which one I had. I realized why I'd always
been so concerned about mistakes and failures. And
Irecognized for the first time that I had a choice.

When you enter a mindset, you enter a new world.
In one world—the world of fixed traits—success is
about proving you're smart or talented. Validating
yourself. In the other—the world of changing qual-
ities—it’s about stretching yourself to learn some-
thing new. Developing yourself.

Inone world, failure is about having a setback. Get-
ting a bad grade. Losing a tournament. Getting fired.
Getting rejected. It means you're not smart or tal-
ented. In the other world, failure is about not grow-
ing. Not reaching for the things you value. It means
you're not fulfilling your potential.

In one world, effort is a bad thing. It, like failure,
means you're not smart or talented. If you were, you
wouldn't need effort. In the other world, effort is
what makes you smart or talented.

You havea choice. Mindsets are just beliefs, They’re
powerful beliefs, but they’re just something in your
mind, and you can change your mind. As you read,
think about where you'd like to go and which mind-
set will take you there.

IS SUCCESS ABOUT LEARNING—
OR PROVING YOU’RE SMART?

Benjamin Barber, an eminent political theorist, once
said, “I don’t divide the world into the weak and the
strong, or the successes and the failures... divide
the world into the learners and nonlearners.”

What on earth would make someone a nonlearner?
Everyone is born with an intense drive to learn.
Infants stretch their skills daily. Not just ordinary
skills, but the most difficult tasks of a lifetime, like
learning to walk and talk. They never decide it’s too
hard or not worth the effort. Babies don't worry
about making mistakes or humiliating themselves.
They walk, they fall, they get up. They just barge
forward.

What could put an end to this exuberant learn-
ing? The fixed mindset. As soon as children become
able to evaluate themselves, some of them become
afraid of challenges. They become afraid of not being
smart. I have studied thousands of people from pre-
schoolers on, and it’s breathtaking how many reject
an opportunity to learn.

We offered four-year-olds a choice: They could
redo an easy jigsaw puzzle or they could try a harder
one. Even at this tender age, children with the fixed
mindset—the ones who believed in fixed traits—
stuck with the safe one. Kids who are born smart
“don’t do mistakes,” they told us.

Children with the growth mindset—the ones who
believed you could get smarter—thought it was a
strange choice. Why are you asking me this, lady? Why
would anyone want to keep doing the same puzzle over
and over? They chose one hard one after another.
“Pm dying to figure them out!” exclaimed one little
girl.

So children with the fixed mindset want to make
sure they succeed. Smart people should always suc-
ceed. But for children with the growth mindset,

reste heure et 35 min danse chapitre 5%


==================================================
Page 39
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

success is about stretching themselves. It’s about be-
coming smarter.

One seventh-grade girl summed it up. “I think
intelligence is something you have to work for...it
isn’t just given to you....Most kids, if they’re not sure
of an answer, will not raise their hand to answer the
question. But what I usually do is raise my hand,
because if I'm wrong, then my mistake will be cor-
rected. Or I will raise my hand and say, ‘How would
this be solved?’ or ‘I don’t get this. Can you help me?”
Just by doing that I’m increasing my intelligence.”

Beyond Puzzles

It’s one thing to pass up a puzzle. It’s another to pass
up an opportunity that’s important to your future.
To see if this would happen, we took advantage of an
unusual situation. At the University of Hong Kong,
everything is in English. Classes are in English, text-
books are in English, and exams are in English. But
some students who enter the university are not flu-
ent in English, so it would make sense for them to do
something about it in a hurry.

As students arrived to register for their freshman
year, we knew which ones were not skilled in Eng-
lish. And we asked them a key question: If the fac-
ulty offered a course for students who need to im-
prove their English skills, would you take it?

We also measured their mindset. We did this by
asking them how much they agreed with state-
ments like this: “You have a certain amount of intel-
ligence, and you can't really do much to change it.”
People who agree with this kind of statement lean
toward a fixed mindset.

Those who lean toward a growth mindset agree
that: “You can always substantially change how
intelligent you are.”

Later, we looked at who said yes to the English
course. Students with the growth mindset said an
emphatic yes. But those with the fixed mindset were
not very interested.

Believing that success is about learning, students
with the growth mindset seized the chance. But
those with the fixed mindset didn’t want to expose
their deficiencies. Instead, to feel smart in the short
run, they were willing to put their college careers at
risk.

This is how the fixed mindset makes people into
nonlearners.

Brain Waves Tell the Story

You can even see the difference in people's brain
waves. People with both mindsets came into our
brain-wave lab at Columbia. As they answered hard
questions and got feedback, we were curious about
when their brain waves would show them to be
interested and attentive.

People with a fixed mindset were only interested
when the feedback reflected on their ability. Their
brain waves showed them paying close attention
when they were told whether their answers were
right or wrong.

But when they were presented with information
that could help them learn, there was no sign of
interest. Even when they'd gotten an answer wrong,
they were not interested in learning what the right
answer was.

Only people with a growth mindset paid close
attention to information that could stretch their
knowledge. Only for them was learning a priority.

What's Your Priority?

If you had to choose, which would it be? Loads of
success and validation or lots of challenge?

It’s not just on intellectual tasks that people have to
make these choices. People also have to decide what
kinds of relationships they want: ones that bolster
their egos or ones that challenge them to grow? Who
is your ideal mate? We put this question to young
adults, and here’s what they told us.

People with the fixed mindset said the ideal mate
would:

Put them on a pedestal.

Make them feel perfect.

Worship them.

In other words, the perfect mate would enshrine
their fixed qualities. My husband says that he used
to feel this way, that he wanted to be the god of a
one-person (his partner’s) religion. Fortunately, he
chucked this idea before he met me.

reste heure et 29 min danse chapitre o%


==================================================
Page 43
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

People with the growth mindset hoped for a differ-
ent kind of partner. They said their ideal mate was
someone who would:

See their faults and help them to work on them.

Challenge them to become a better person.

Encourage them to learn new things.

Certainly, they didn’t want people who would pick
on them or undermine their self-esteem, but they
did want people who would foster their develop-
ment. They didn’t assume they were fully evolved,
flawless beings who had nothing more to learn.

Are you already thinking, Uh-oh, what if two people
with different mindsets get together? A growth-mind-
set woman tells about her marriage to a fixed-mind-
set man:

Thad barely gotten all the rice out of my hair
when I began to realize I made a big mistake.
Every time I said something like “Why don’t
we try to go out a little more?” or “I'd like
it if you consulted me before making deci-
sions,” he was devastated. Then instead of
talking about the issue I raised, I'd have to
spend literally an hour repairing the dam-

age and making him feel good again. Plus
he would then run to the phone to call his
mother, who always showered him with the
constant adoration he seemed to need. We
were both young and new at marriage. I just
wanted to communicate.

So the husband's idea of a successful relationship—
total, uncritical acceptance—was not the wife’s. And
the wife's idea of a successful relationship—con-
fronting problems—was not the husband's. One per-
son's growth was the other person's nightmare.

CEO Disease

Speaking of reigning from atop a pedestal and want-
ing to be seen as perfect, you won't be surprised
that this is often called “CEO disease.” Lee Iacocca
had a bad case of it. After his initial success as head
of Chrysler Motors, Iacocca looked remarkably like
our four-year-olds with the fixed mindset. He kept
bringing out the same car models over and over with
only superficial changes. Unfortunately, they were
models no one wanted anymore.

Meanwhile, Japanese companies were completely
rethinking what cars should look like and how they
should run. We know how this turned out. The Jap-
anese cars rapidly swept the market.

CEOs face this choice all the time. Should they
confront their shortcomings or should they create a
world where they have none? Lee Iacocca chose the
latter, He surrounded himself with worshipers, ex-
iled the critics—and quickly lost touch with where
his field was going. Lee Iacocca had become a non-
learner.

But not everyone catches CEO disease. Many great
leaders confront their shortcomings on a regular
basis. Darwin Smith, looking back on his extraor-
dinary performance at Kimberly-Clark, declared, “I
never stopped trying to be qualified for the job.”
These men, like the Hong Kong students with the
growth mindset, never stopped taking the remedial
course.

CEOs face another dilemma. They can choose
short-term strategies that boost the company’s
stock and make themselves look like heroes. Or they
can work for long-term improvement—risking Wall
Street's disapproval as they lay the foundation for

the health and growth of the company over the
longer haul.

Albert Dunlap, a self-professed fixed mindsetter,
was brought in to turn around Sunbeam. He chose
the short-term strategy of looking like a hero to Wall
Street. The stock soared but the company fell apart.

Lou Gerstner, an avowed growth mindsetter, was
called in to turn around IBM. As he set about the
enormous task of overhauling IBM culture and pol-
icies, stock prices were stagnant and Wall Street
sneered, They called him a failure. A few years later,
however, IBM was leading its field again.

Stretching

People in a growth mindset don’t just seek chal-
lenge, they thrive on it. The bigger the challenge,
the more they stretch. And nowhere can it be seen
more clearly than in the world of sports. You can just
watch people stretch and grow.

Mia Hamm, the greatest female soccer star of her
time, says it straight out. “All my life I've been play-
ing up, meaning I’ve challenged myself with players
older, bigger, more skillful, more experienced—in

short, better than me.” First she played with her
older brother. Then at ten, she joined the eleven-
year-old boys’ team. Then she threw herself into the
number one college team in the United States. “Each
day I attempted to play up to their level...and I was
improving faster than I ever dreamed possible.”
Patricia Miranda was a chubby, unathletic high
school kid who wanted to wrestle. After a bad beat-
ing on the mat, she was told, “You're a joke.” First
she cried, then she felt: “That really set my resolve...I
had to keep going and had to knowif effort and focus
and belief and training could somehow legitimize
me as a wrestler.” Where did she get this resolve?

Miranda was raised in a life devoid of challenge.
But when her mother died of an aneurysm at age
forty, ten-year-old Miranda came up with a prin-
ciple. “When you're lying on your deathbed, one of
the cool things to say is, ‘I really explored myself.
This sense of urgency was instilled when my mom
died. If you only go through life doing stuff that’s
easy, shame on you.” So when wrestling presented a
challenge, she was ready to take it on.

Her effort paid off. At twenty-four, Miranda was
having the last laugh. She won the spot for her

home from Athens with a bronze medal. And what
was next? Yale Law School. People urged her to stay
where she was already on top, but Miranda felt it was
more exciting to start at the bottom again and see
what she could grow into this time.

Stretching Beyond the Possible

Sometimes people with the growth mindset stretch
themselves so far that they do the impossible. In
1995, Christopher Reeve, the actor, was thrown
from a horse. His neck was broken, his spinal cord
was severed from his brain, and he was completely
paralyzed below the neck. Medical science said, So
sorry. Come to terms with it.

Reeve, however, started a demanding exercise pro-
gram that involved moving all parts of his para-
lyzed body with the help of electrical stimulation.
Why couldn’t he learn to move again? Why couldn’t
his brain once again give commands that his body
would obey? Doctors warned that he was in de-
nial and was setting himself up for disappointment.
They had seen this before and it was a bad sign

for his adjustment. But, really, what else was Reeve
doing with his time? Was there a better project?

Five years later, Reeve started to regain movement.
First it happened in his hands, then his arms, then
legs, and then torso. He was far from cured, but brain
scans showed that his brain was once more sending
signals to his body that the body was responding to.
Not only did Reeve stretch his abilities, he changed
the entire way science thinks about the nervous sys-
tem and its potential for recovery. In doing so, he
opened a whole new vista for research and a whole
new avenue of hope for people with spinal cord in-
juries.

Thriving on the Sure Thing

Clearly, people with the growth mindset thrive
when they’re stretching themselves. When do
people with the fixed mindset thrive? When things
are safely within their grasp. If things get too chal-
lenging—when they’re not feeling smart or talented
—they lose interest.

I watched it happen as we followed pre-med stu-
dents through their first semester of chemistry. For

many students, this is what their lives have led up
to: becoming a doctor. And this is the course that
decides who gets to be one. It’s one heck of a hard
course, too. The average grade on each exam is C+,
for students who've rarely seen anything less than
anA.

Most students started out pretty interested in
chemistry. Yet over the semester, something hap-
pened. Students with the fixed mindset stayed inter-
ested only when they did well right away. Those who
found it difficult showed a big drop in their inter-
est and enjoyment. If it wasn't a testimony to their
intelligence, they couldn't enjoy it.

“The harder it gets,” reported one student, “the
more I have to force myself to read the book and
study for the tests. Iwas excited about chemistry be-
fore, but now every time I think about it, I get a bad
feeling in my stomach.”

In contrast, students with the growth mindset
continued to show the same high level of interest
even when they found the work very challenging.
“q's a lot more difficult for me than I thought it
would be, but it’s what I want to do, so that only
makes me more determined. When they tell me I

can’t, it really gets me going.” Challenge and interest
went hand in hand.

We saw the same thing in younger students. We
gave fifth graders intriguing puzzles, which they all
loved. But when we made them harder, children
with the fixed mindset showed a big plunge in enjoy-
ment. They also changed their minds about taking
some home to practice. “It’s okay, you can keep them.
Talready have them,” fibbed one child. In fact, they
couldn’t run from them fast enough.

This was just as true for children who were the best
puzzle solvers. Having “puzzle talent” did not pre-
vent the decline.

Children with the growth mindset, on the other
hand, couldn't tear themselves away from the hard
problems. These were their favorites and these were
the ones they wanted to take home. “Could you write
down the name of these puzzles,” one child asked,
“so my mom can buy me some more when these
ones run out?”

Not long ago I was interested to read about Marina
Semyonova, a great Russian dancer and teacher, who
devised a novel way of selecting her students. It was
a clever test for mindset. As a former student tells

it, “Her students first have to survive a trial period
while she watches to see how you react to praise and
to correction. Those more responsive to the correc-
tion are deemed worthy.”

In other words, she separates the ones who get
their thrill from what's easy—what they've already
mastered—from those who get their thrill from
what's hard.

I'll never forget the first time I heard myself say,
“This is hard. This is fun.” That's the moment I knew
Iwas changing mindsets.

When Do You Feel Smart: When You're
Flawless or When You're Learning?

The plot is about to thicken, for in the fixed mindset
it’s not enough just to succeed. It’s not enough just to
look smart and talented. You have to be pretty much
flawless. And you have to be flawless right away.

We asked people, ranging from grade schoolers to
young adults, “When do you feel smart?” The differ-
ences were striking. People with the fixed mindset
said:

reste 1 heureet 16 min danse chapite 8%


==================================================
Page 53
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

“It’s when I don’t make any mistakes.”

“When I finish something fast and it’s perfect.”

“when something is easy for me, but other people
can’t do it.”

It’s about being perfect right now. But people with
the growth mindset said:

“When it’s really hard, and I try really hard, and I
can do something I couldn’t do before.”

Or “[When] I work on something a long time and I
start to figure it out.”

For them it’s not about immediate perfection. It’s
about learning something over time: confronting a
challenge and making progress.

If You Have Ability, Why Should You Need Learning?

Actually, people with the fixed mindset expect abil-
ity to show up on its own, before any learning takes
place. After all, if you have it you have it, and if you
don’t you don't. I see this all the time.

Out of all the applicants from all over the world,
my department at Columbia admitted six new
graduate students a year. They all had amazing test

scores, nearly perfect grades, and rave recommenda-
tions from eminent scholars. Moreover, they’d been
courted by the top grad schools.

It took one day for some of them to feel like com-
plete imposters. Yesterday they were hotshots; today
they’re failures. Here's what happens. They look at
the faculty with our long list of publications. “Oh
my God, I can’t do that.” They look at the advanced
students who are submitting articles for publication
and writing grant proposals. “Oh my God, I can’t do
that.” They know how to take tests and get A’s but
they don’t know how to do this—yet. They forget the
yet.

Isn’t that what school is for, to teach? They’re there
to learn how to do these things, not because they al-
ready know everything.

I wonder if this is what happened to Janet Cooke
and Stephen Glass. They were both young reporters
who skyrocketed to the top—on fabricated articles.
Janet Cooke won a Pulitzer Prize for her Washington
Post articles about an eight-year-old boy who was a
drug addict. The boy did not exist, and she was later
stripped of her prize. Stephen Glass was the whiz kid
of The New Republic, who seemed to have stories and

sources reporters only dream of. The sources did not
exist and the stories were not true.

Did Janet Cooke and Stephen Glass need to be
perfect right away? Did they feel that admitting ig-
norance would discredit them with their colleagues?
Did they feel they should already be like the big-time
reporters before they did the hard work of learn-
ing how? “We were stars—precocious stars,” wrote
Stephen Glass, “and that was what mattered.” The
public understands them as cheats, and cheat they
did. But I understand them as talented young people
—desperate young people—who succumbed to the
pressures of the fixed mindset.

There was a saying in the 1960s that went: “Be-
coming is better than being.” The fixed mindset does
not allow people the luxury of becoming, They have
to already be.

A Test Score Is Forever

Let's take a closer look at why, in the fixed mindset,
it’s so crucial to be perfect right now. It’s because one
test—or one evaluation—can measure you forever.

Twenty years ago, at the age of five, Loretta and her
family came to the United States. A few days later,
her mother took her to her new school, where they
promptly gave her a test. The next thing she knew,
she was in her kindergarten class—but it was not the
Eagles, the elite kindergarten class.

As time passed, however, Loretta was transferred
to the Eagles and she remained with that group of
students until the end of high school, garnering a
bundle of academic prizes along the way. Yet she
never felt she belonged.

That first test, she was convinced, diagnosed her
fixed ability and said that she was not a true Eagle.
Never mind that she had been five years old and had
just made a radical change to a new country. Or that
maybe there hadn't been room in the Eagles for a
while. Or that maybe the school decided she would
have an easier transition in a more low-key class.
There are so many ways to understand what hap-
pened and what it meant. Unfortunately, she chose
the wrong one. For in the world of the fixed mindset,
there is no way to become an Eagle. If you were a true
Eagle, you would have aced the test and been hailed
as an Eagle at once.

more common than we realize?

To find out, we showed fifth graders a closed card-
board box and told them it had a test inside. This
test, we said, measured an important school ability.
We told them nothing more. Then we asked them
questions about the test. First, we wanted to make
sure that they’d accepted our description, so we
asked them: How much do you think this test meas-
ures an important school ability? All of them had
taken our word for it.

Next we asked: Do you think this test measures
how smart you are? And: Do you think this test meas-
ures how smart you'll be when you grow up?

Students with the growth mindset had taken our
word that the test measured an important ability,
but they didn’t think it measured how smart they
were. And they certainly didn’t think it would tell
them how smart they'd be when they grew up. In
fact, one of them told us, “No way! Ain’t no test can
do that.”

But the students with the fixed mindset didn’t
simply believe the test could measure an important
ability. They also believed—just as strongly—that it

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

could measure how smart they were. And how smart
they'd be when they grew up.

They granted one test the power to measure their
most basic intelligence now and forever. They gave
this test the power to define them. That's why every
success is so important.

Another Look at Potential

This leads us back to the idea of “potential” and to
the question of whether tests or experts can tell us
what our potential is, what we're capable of, what
our future will be. The fixed mindset says yes. You
can simply measure the fixed ability right now and
project it into the future. Just give the test or ask the
expert. No crystal ball needed.

So common is the belief that potential can be
known right now that Joseph P. Kennedy felt confi-
dent in telling Morton Downey Jr. that he would be
a failure. What had Downey—later a famous tele-
vision personality and author—done? Why, he had
worn red socks and brown shoes to the Stork Club, a
fancy New York nightclub.

“Morton,” Kennedy told him, “I don’t know any-
body I’ve ever met in my life wearing red socks and
brown shoes who ever succeeded. Young man, let me
tell you now, you do stand out, but you don’t stand
out in a way that people will ever admire you.”

Many of the most accomplished people of our era
were considered by experts to have no future. Jack-
son Pollock, Marcel Proust, Elvis Presley, Ray Charles,
Lucille Ball, and Charles Darwin were all thought to
have little potential for their chosen fields. And in
some of these cases, it may well have been true that
they did not stand out from the crowd early on.

But isn’t potential someone's capacity to develop
their skills with effort and coaching over time? And
that’s just the point. How can we know where effort,
coaching, and time will take someone? Who knows
—maybe the experts were right about Jackson, Mar-
cel, Elvis, Ray, Lucille, and Charles—in terms of their
skills at the time. Maybe they were not yet the people
they were to become.

I once went to an exhibit in London of Paul
Cézanne’s early paintings. On my way there, I won-
dered who Cézanne was and what his paintings
were like before he was the painter we know today.

I was intensely curious because Cézanne is one of
my favorite artists and the man who set the stage
for much of modern art. Here's what I found: Some
of the paintings were pretty bad. They were over-
wrought scenes, some violent, with amateurishly
painted people. Although there were some paintings
that foreshadowed the later Cézanne, many did not.
Was the early Cézanne not talented? Or did it just
take time for Cézanne to become Cézanne?

People with the growth mindset know that it takes
time for potential to flower. Recently, I got an angry
letter from a teacher who had taken one of our sur-
veys. The survey portrays a hypothetical student,
Jennifer, who had gotten 65 percent on a math exam.
It then asks teachers to tell us how they would treat
her.

Teachers with the fixed mindset were more than
happy to answer our questions. They felt that by
knowing Jennifer's score, they had a good sense of
who she was and what she was capable of. Their rec-
ommendations abounded. Mr. Riordan, by contrast,
was fuming. Here’s what he wrote.

To Whom It May Concern:

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

Having completed the educator's portion
of your recent survey, I must request that
my results be excluded from the study. I

feel that the study itself is scientifically
unsound....

Unfortunately, the test uses a faulty prem-
ise, asking teachers to make assumptions
about a given student based on nothing
more than a number on a page....Perform-
ance cannot be based on one assessment.

You cannot determine the slope of a line
given only one point, as there is no line to
begin with. A single point in time does not
show trends, improvement, lack of effort, or
mathematical ability...

Sincerely,
Michael D. Riordan

I was delighted with Mr. Riordan’s critique and
couldn't have agreed with it more. An assessment at
one point in time has little value for understanding
someone's ability, let alone their potential to succeed
in the future.

It was disturbing how many teachers thought
otherwise, and that was the point of our study.

The idea that one evaluation can measure you for-
ever is what creates the urgency for those with the
fixed mindset. That's why they must succeed per-
fectly and immediately. Who can afford the luxury
of trying to grow when everything is on the line
right now?

Is there another way to judge potential? NASA
thought so. When they were soliciting applications
for astronauts, they rejected people with pure his-
tories of success and instead selected people who
had had significant failures and bounced back from
them. Jack Welch, the celebrated CEO of General
Electric, chose executives on the basis of “runway,”
their capacity for growth. And remember Marina
Semyonova, the famed ballet teacher, who chose
the students who were energized by criticism. They
were all rejecting the idea of fixed ability and select-
ing instead for mindset.

over growth, what are they really trying to prove?
That they’re special. Even superior.

When we asked them, “When do you feel smart?”
so many of them talked about times they felt like a
special person, someone who was different from and
better than other people.

Until I discovered the mindsets and how they
work, I, too, thought of myself as more talented
than others, maybe even more worthy than others
because of my endowments. The scariest thought,
which I rarely entertained, was the possibility of
being ordinary. This kind of thinking led me to need
constant validation. Every comment, every look
was meaningful—it registered on my intelligence
scorecard, my attractiveness scorecard, my likability
scorecard. If a day went well, I could bask in my high
numbers.

One bitter cold winter night, I went to the opera.
That night, the opera was everything you hope for,
and everyone stayed until the very end—not just the
end of the opera, but through all the curtain calls.
Then we all poured into the street, and we all wanted
taxis. I remember it clearly. It was after midnight, it
was seven degrees, there was a strong wind, and, as

time went on, I became more and more miserable.
There I was, part of an undifferentiated crowd. What
chance did I have? Suddenly, a taxi pulled up right
next to me. The handle of the back door lined up
perfectly with my hand, and as I entered, the driver
announced, “You were different.” I lived for these
moments. Not only was I special. It could be detected
from a distance.

The self-esteem movement encourages this kind of
thinking and has even invented devices to help you
confirm your superiority. I recently came across an
ad for such a product. Two of my friends send me an
illustrated list each year of the top ten things they
didn’t get me for Christmas. From January through
November, they clip candidate items from catalogs
or download them from the Internet. In December,
they select the winners. One of my all-time favorites
is the pocket toilet, which you fold up and return to
your pocket after using. This year my favorite was
the I LOVE ME mirror, a mirror with 1 LOVE ME in
huge capital letters written across the bottom half.
By looking into it, you can administer the message
to yourself and not wait for the outside world to an-
nounce your specialness.

Of course, the mirror is harmless enough. The
problem is when special begins to mean better than
others. A more valuable human being. A superior
person. An entitled person.

Special, Superior, Entitled

John McEnroe had a fixed mindset: He believed that
talent was all. He did not love to learn. He did not
thrive on challenges; when the going got rough, he
often folded. As a result, by his own admission, he
did not fulfill his potential.

But his talent was so great that he was the number
one tennis player in the world for four years. Here he
tells us what it was like to be number one.

McEnroe used sawdust to absorb the sweat on his
hands during a match. This time the sawdust was
not to his liking, so he went over to the can of
sawdust and knocked it over with his racket. His
agent, Gary, came dashing over to find out what was
wrong.

“You call that sawdust?” I said. I was actually
screaming at him: The sawdust was ground

too fine! “This looks like rat poison. Can't
you get anything right?” So Gary ran out
and, twenty minutes later, came back with
a fresh can of coarser sawdust...and twenty
dollars less in his pocket: He’d had to pay a
union employee to grind up a two-by-four.
This is what it was like to be number one.

He goes on to tell us about how he once threw up
all over a dignified Japanese lady who was hosting
him. The next day she bowed, apologized to him,
and presented him with a gift. “This,” McEnroe pro-
claims, “is also what it was like to be number one.”

“Everything was about you...‘Did you get every-
thing you need? Is everything okay? We'll pay you
this, we'll do that, we'll kiss your behind.’ You only
have to do what you want; your reaction to anything
else is, ‘Get the hell out of here.’ For a long time I
didn’t mind it a bit. Would you?”

So let’s see. If you're successful, you're better than
other people. You get to abuse them and have them
grovel. In the fixed mindset, this is what can pass for
self-esteem.

Asacontrast, let’s look at Michael Jordan—growth-
minded athlete par excellence—whose greatness is
regularly proclaimed by the world: “Superman,”
“God in person,” “Jesus in tennis shoes.” If anyone
has reason to think of himself as special, it’s he. But
here’s what he said when his return to basketball
caused a huge commotion: “I was shocked with the
level of intensity my coming back to the game cre-
ated....People were praising me like I was a religious
cult or something. That was very embarrassing. I'm
a human being like everyone else.”

Jordan knew how hard he had worked to develop
his abilities. He was a person who had struggled and
grown, not a person who was inherently better than
others.

Tom Wolfe, in The Right Stuff, describes the elite
military pilots who eagerly embrace the fixed mind-
set. Having passed one rigorous test after another,
they think of themselves as special, as people who
were born smarter and braver than other people. But
Chuck Yeager, the hero of The Right Stuff, begged
to differ. “There is no such thing as a natural-born
pilot. Whatever my aptitude or talents, becoming
a proficient pilot was hard work, really a lifetime’s

learning experience... The best pilots fly more than
the others; that’s why they’re the best.” Like Michael
Jordan, he was a human being. He just stretched
himself farther than most.

In short, people who believe in fixed traits feel an
urgency to succeed, and when they do, they may feel
more than pride. They may feel a sense of superior-
ity, since success means that their fixed traits are
better than other people's.

However, lurking behind that self-esteem of the
fixed mindset is a simple question: If you're some-
body when you're successful, what are you when
you're unsuccessful?

MINDSETS CHANGE THE MEANING OF FAILURE

The Martins worshiped their three-year-old Robert
and always bragged about his feats. There had never
been a child as bright and creative as theirs. Then
Robert did something unforgivable—he didn’t get
into the number one preschool in New York. After
that, the Martins cooled toward him. They didn’t
talk about him the same way, and they didn’t treat

him with the same pride and affection. He was no
longer their brilliant little Robert. He was someone
who had discredited himself and shamed them. At
the tender age of three, he was a failure.

As a New York Times article points out, failure has
been transformed from an action (I failed) to an
identity (I am a failure). This is especially true in the
fixed mindset.

When I was a child, I, too, worried about meeting
Robert's fate. In sixth grade, I was the best speller in
my school. The principal wanted me to go to a city-
wide competition, but I refused. In ninth grade, lex-
celled in French, and my teacher wanted me to enter
acitywide competition. Again, Irefused. Why would
I risk turning from a success into a failure? From a
winner into a loser?

Ernie Els, the great golfer, worried about this too.
Els finally won a major tournament after a five-year
dry spell, in which match after match slipped away
from him. What if he had lost this tournament, too?
“I would have been a different person,” he tells us. He
would have been a loser.

tion letters—arrive from colleges, countless failures

are created coast to coast. Thousands of brilliant
young scholars become “The Girl Who Didn't Get
into Princeton” or the “The Boy Who Didn't Get into
Stanford.”

Defining Moments

Even in the growth mindset, failure can be a painful
experience. But it doesn’t define you. It’s a problem
to be faced, dealt with, and learned from.

Jim Marshall, former defensive player for the Min-
nesota Vikings, relates what could easily have made
him into a failure. In a game against the San Fran-
cisco 49ers, Marshall spotted the football on the
ground. He scooped it up and ran for a touchdown
as the crowd cheered. But he ran the wrong way. He
scored for the wrong team and on national televi-
sion.

It was the most devastating moment of his life.
The shame was overpowering. But during halftime,
he thought, “If you make a mistake, you got to make
it right. I realized I had a choice. I could sit in my
misery or I could do something about it.” Pulling
himself together for the second half, he played some

of his best football ever and contributed to his team’s
victory.

Nor did he stop there. He spoke to groups. He
answered letters that poured in from people who
finally had the courage to admit their own shameful
experiences. He heightened his concentration dur-
ing games. Instead of letting the experience define
him, he took control of it. He used it to become a bet-
ter player and, he believes, a better person.

In the fixed mindset, however, the loss of one’s
self to failure can be a permanent, haunting trauma.
Bernard Loiseau was one of the top chefs in the
world. Only a handful of restaurants in all of France
receive the supreme rating of three stars from the
Guide Michelin, the most respected restaurant guide
in Europe. His was one of them. Around the publica-
tion of the 2003 Guide Michelin, however, Mr. Lois-
eau committed suicide. He had lost two points in
another guide, going from a nineteen (out of twenty)
to a seventeen in the GaultMillau. And there were
rampant rumors that he would lose one of his three
stars in the new Guide. Although he did not, the idea
of failure had possessed him.

Loiseau had been a pioneer. He was one of the first
to advance the “nouvelle cuisine,” trading the trad-
itional butter and cream sauces of French cooking
for the brighter flavors of the foods themselves. A
man of tremendous energy, he was also an entrepre-
neur. Besides his three-star restaurant in Burgundy,
he had created three eateries in Paris, numerous
cookbooks, and a line of frozen foods. “I’m like Yves
Saint Laurent,” he told people. “I do both haute cou-
ture and ready-to-wear.”

A man of such talent and originality could easily
have planned for a satisfying future, with or with-
out the two points or the third star. In fact, the dir-
ector of the GaultMillau said it was unimaginable
that their rating could have taken his life. But in the
fixed mindset, it is imaginable. Their lower rating
gave him a new definition of himself: Failure. Has-
been.

It’s striking what counts as failure in the fixed
mindset. So, on a lighter note...

ranch, something very novel since neither of us had
ever made contact with a horse. One day, we signed
up for a lesson in fly fishing. It was taught by a won-
derful eighty-year-old cowboy-type fisherman who
showed us how to cast the fishing line, and then
turned us loose.

We soon realized that he had not taught us how to
recognize when the trout bit the lure (they don’t tug
on the line; you have to watch for a bubble in the
water), what to do when the trout bit the lure (tug
upward), or how to reel the trout in if by some mir-
acle we got that far (pull the fish along the water; do
not hoist it into the air). Well, time passed, the mos-
quitoes bit, but not so the trout. None of the dozen or
so of us made the slightest progress. Suddenly, I hit
the jackpot. Some careless trout bit hard on my lure
and the fisherman, who happened to be right there,
talked me through the rest. I had me a rainbow trout.

looked at them blankly; he had no idea what they
were talking about. Of course he didn't. He was the
one who thought my catching the fish was exciting.
But I knew exactly what they meant. They had ex-
pected him to feel diminished, and they went on to
make it clear that that’s exactly what my success had
done to them.

Shirk, Cheat, Blame: Not a Recipe for Success

Beyond how traumatic a setback can be in the fixed
mindset, this mindset gives you no good recipe for
overcoming it. If failure means you lack competence
or potential—that you are a failure—where do you
go from there?

In one study, seventh graders told us how they
would respond to an academic failure—a poor test
grade in anew course. Those with the growth mind-
set, no big surprise, said they would study harder for
the next test. But those with the fixed mindset said
they would study less for the next test. If you don’t
have the ability, why waste your time? And, they
said, they would seriously consider cheating! If you

don’t have the ability, they thought, you just have to
look for another way.

What's more, instead of trying to learn from and
repair their failures, people with the fixed mindset
may simply try to repair their self-esteem. For ex-
ample, they may go looking for people who are even
worse off than they are.

College students, after doing poorly ona test, were
given a chance to look at tests of other students.
Those in the growth mindset looked at the tests of
people who had done far better than they had. As
usual, they wanted to correct their deficiency. But
students in the fixed mindset chose to look at the
tests of people who had done really poorly. That was
their way of feeling better about themselves.

Jim Collins tells in Good to Great of a similar thing
in the corporate world. As Procter & Gamble surged
into the paper goods business, Scott Paper—which
was then the leader—just gave up. Instead of mobil-
izing themselves and putting up a fight, they said,
“Oh, well...at least there are people in the business
worse off than we are.”

Another way people with the fixed mindset try to
repair their self-esteem after a failure is by assign-

ing blame or making excuses. Let’s return to John
McEnroe.

It was never his fault. One time he lost a match
because he had a fever. One time he had a backache.
One time he fell victim to expectations, another
time to the tabloids. One time he lost to a friend be-
cause the friend was in love and he wasn't. One time
he ate too close to the match. One time he was too
chunky, another time too thin. One time it was too
cold, another time too hot. One time he was under-
trained, another time overtrained.

His most agonizing loss, and the one that still
keeps him up nights, was his loss in the 1984 French
Open. Why did he lose after leading Ivan Lendl two
sets to none? According to McEnroe, it wasn’t his
fault. An NBC cameraman had taken off his head-
set and a noise started coming from the side of the
court.

Not his fault. So he didn’t train to improve his abil-
ity to concentrate or his emotional control.

John Wooden, the legendary basketball coach, says
you aren't a failure until you start to blame. What he
means is that you can still be in the process of iearn-
ing from your mistakes until you deny them.

When Enron, the energy giant, failed—toppled by

genius. It was the world’s fault. The world did not

the Justice Department's investigation into massive
corporate deception? A “witch hunt.”

Jack Welch, the growth-minded CEO, had a com-
pletely different reaction to one of General Electric's
fiascos. In 1986, General Electric bought Kidder, Pea-
body, a Wall Street investment banking firm. Soon
after the deal closed, Kidder, Peabody was hit with a
big insider trading scandal. A few years later, calam-
ity struck again in the form of Joseph Jett, a trader
who made a bunch of fictitious trades, to the tune of
hundreds of millions, to pump up his bonus. Welch
phoned fourteen of his top GE colleagues to tell them
the bad news and to apologize personally. “I blamed
myself for the disaster,” Welch said.

Mindset and Depression

As a psychologist and an educator, I am vitally
interested in depression. It runs wild on college cam-
puses, especially in February and March. The win-
ter is not over, the summer is not in sight, work
has piled up, and relationships are often frayed. Yet
it’s been clear to me for a long time that different
students handle depression in dramatically differ-
ent ways. Some let everything slide. Others, though
feeling wretched, hang on. They drag themselves
to class, keep up with their work, and take care
of themselves—so that when they feel better, their
lives are intact.

Not long ago, we decided to see whether mindsets
play a role in this difference. To find out, we meas-
ured students’ mindsets and then had them keep
an online “diary” for three weeks in February and
March. Every day they answered questions about
their mood, their activities, and how they were cop-
ing with problems. Here’s what we discovered.

First, the students with the fixed mindset had
higher levels of depression. Our analyses showed
that this was because they ruminated over their
problems and setbacks, essentially tormenting
themselves with the idea that the setbacks meant

{reste 41 mindanslechapitre 19%

they were incompetent or unworthy: “It just kept
circulating in my head: You're a dope.” “I just
couldn't let go of the thought that this made me less
of aman.” Again, failures labeled them and left them
no route to success.

And the more depressed they felt, the more they
let things go; the less they took action to solve their
problems. For example, they didn't study what they
needed to, they didn’t hand in their assignments on
time, and they didn’t keep up with their chores.

Although students with the fixed mindset showed
more depression, there were still plenty of people
with the growth mindset who felt pretty miserable,
this being peak season for depression. And here we
saw something really amazing. The more depressed
people with the growth mindset felt (short of severe
depression), the more they took action to confront
their problems, the more they made sure to keep up
with their schoolwork, and the more they kept up
with their lives. The worse they felt, the more deter-
mined they became!

In fact, from the way they acted, it might have been
hard to know how despondent they were. Here is a
story a young man told me.

I was a freshman and it was the first time I
had been away from home. Everyone was a
stranger, the courses were hard, and as the
year wore on I felt more and more depressed.
Eventually, it reached a point where I could
hardly get out of bed in the morning. But
every day I forced myself to get up, shower,
shave, and do whatever it was I needed to do.
One day I really hit a low point and I decided
to ask for help, so I went to the teaching as-
sistant in my psychology course and asked
for her advice.

“Are you going to your classes?” she asked.

“Yes,” replied.

“are you keeping up with your reading?”

“Yes.”

“are you doing okay on your exams?”

“Yes.”

“Well,” she informed me, “then you're not
depressed.”

‘Yes, he was depressed, but he was coping the way
people in the growth mindset tend to cope—with
determination.

Doesn’t temperament have a lot to do with it?
Aren’t some people sensitive by nature, while others
just let things roll off their backs? Temperament
certainly plays a role, but mindset is an important
part of the story. When we taught people the growth
mindset, it changed the way they reacted to their de-
pressed mood. The worse they felt, the more motiv-
ated they became and the more they confronted the
problems that faced them.

In short, when people believe in fixed traits, they
are always in danger of being measured by a failure.
It can define them in a permanent way. Smart or
talented as they may be, this mindset seems to rob
them of their coping resources.

When people believe their basic qualities can be
developed, failures may still hurt, but failures don’t
define them. And if abilities can be expanded—if
change and growth are possible—then there are still
many paths to success.

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

MINDSETS CHANGE THE MEANING OF EFFORT

As children, we were given a choice between the tal-
ented but erratic hare and the plodding but steady
tortoise. The lesson was supposed to be that slow
and steady wins the race. But, really, did any of us
ever want to be the tortoise?

No, we just wanted to be a less foolish hare. We
wanted to be swift as the wind and a bit more stra-
tegic—say, not taking quite so many snoozes before
the finish line. After all, everyone knows you have to
show up in order to win.

The story of the tortoise and the hare, in trying
to put forward the power of effort, gave effort a bad
name. It reinforced the image that effort is for the
plodders and suggested that in rare instances, when
talented people dropped the ball, the plodder could
sneak through.

The little engine that could, the saggy, baggy ele-
phant, and the scruffy tugboat—they were cute,
they were often overmatched, and we were happy
for them when they succeeded. In fact, to this day

$YCHOLOGY OF SUC.

I remember how fond I was of those little creatures
(or machines), but no way did I identify with them.
The message was: If you're unfortunate enough to be
the runt of the litter—if you lack endowment—you
don't have to be an utter failure. You can be a sweet,
adorable little slogger, and maybe (if you really work
at it and withstand all the scornful onlookers) even a
success.

Thank you very much, I'll take the endowment.

The problem was that these stories made it into
an either-or. Either you have ability or you expend
effort. And this is part of the fixed mindset. Effort is
for those who don’t have the ability. People with the
fixed mindset tell us, “If you have to work at some-
thing, you must not be good at it.” They add, “Things
come easily to people who are true geniuses.”

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

I was a young professor in the psychology depart-
ment at the University of Illinois. Late one night,
I was passing the psychology building and noticed
that the lights were on in some faculty offices. Some
of my colleagues were working late. They must not be
as smart as Iam, I thought to myself.

It never occurred to me that they might be just as
smart and more hardworking! For me it was either-
or. And it was clear I valued the either over the or.

Malcolm Gladwell, the author and New Yorker
writer, has suggested that as a society we value
natural, effortless accomplishment over achieve-
ment through effort. We endow our heroes with
superhuman abilities that led them inevitably to-
ward their greatness. It’s as if Midori popped out of
the womb fiddling, Michael Jordan dribbling, and Pi-
casso doodling. This captures the fixed mindset per-
fectly. And it’s everywhere.

A report from researchers at Duke University
sounds an alarm about the anxiety and depression
among female undergraduates who aspire to “effort-
less perfection.” They believe they should display
perfect beauty, perfect womanhood, and perfect

scholarship all without trying (or at least without
appearing to try).

Americans aren’t the only people who disdain
effort. French executive Pierre Chevalier says, “We
are not a nation of effort. After all, if you have sa-
voir-faire [a mixture of know-how and cool], you do
things effortlessly.”

People with the growth mindset, however, believe
something very different. For them, even geniuses
have to work hard for their achievements. And
what's so heroic, they would say, about having a gift?
They may appreciate endowment, but they admire
effort, for no matter what your ability is, effort is
what ignites that ability and turns it into accom-
plishment.

Seabiscuit

Here was a horse who was so broken, he was sup-
posed to be put to sleep. In fact, here was a whole
team of people—the jockey, the owner, the trainer
—who were damaged in one way or another. Yet
through their dogged determination and against all
odds, they transformed themselves into winners. A

down-and-out nation saw this horse and rider as a
symbol of what could be accomplished through grit
and spirit.

Equally moving is the parallel story about Sea-
biscuit’s author, Laura Hillenbrand. Felled in her col-
lege years by severe, recurrent chronic fatigue that
never went away, she was often unable to function.
Yet something in the story of the “horse who could”
gripped and inspired her, so that she was able to
write a heartfelt, magnificent story about the tri-
umph of will. The book was a testament to Sea-
biscuit’s triumph and her own, equally.

Seen through the lens of the growth mindset, these
are stories about the transformative power of effort
—the power of effort to change your ability and to
change you as a person. But filtered through the
fixed mindset, it’s a great story about three men and
a horse, all with deficiencies, who had to try very
hard.

High Effort: The Big Risk

From the point of view of the fixed mindset, effort is
only for people with deficiencies. And when people

Page 87

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

already know they’re deficient, maybe they have
nothing to lose by trying. But if your claim to fame
is not having any deficiencies—if you're considered a
genius, a talent, or a natural—then you have a lot to
lose. Effort can reduce you.

Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg made her violin debut
at the age of ten with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Yet
when she arrived at Juilliard to study with Dorothy
DeLay, the great violin teacher, she had a repertoire
of awful habits. Her fingerings and bowings were
awkward and she held her violin in the wrong posi-
tion, but she refused to change. After several years,
she saw the other students catching up and even
surpassing her, and by her late teens she had a crisis
of confidence. “I was used to success, to the prodigy
label in newspapers, and now I felt like a failure.”

This prodigy was afraid of trying. “Everything I
was going through boiled down to fear. Fear of try-
ing and failing....If you go to an audition and don’t
really try, if you're not really prepared, if you didn’t
work as hard as you could have and you don't win,
you have an excuse....Nothing is harder than saying,
‘gave it my all and it wasn’t good enough.”

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

The idea of trying and still failing—of leaving
yourself without excuses—is the worst fear within
the fixed mindset, and it haunted and paralyzed her.
She had even stopped bringing her violin to her les-
son!

Then, one day, after years of patience and under-
standing, DeLay told her, “Listen, if you don’t bring
your violin next week, I’m throwing you out of my
class.” Salerno-Sonnenberg thought she was joking,
but DeLay rose from the couch and calmly informed
her, “I’m not kidding. If you are going to waste your
talent, Idon’t want to bea part of it. This has gone on
long enough.”

Why is effort so terrifying?

There are two reasons. One is that in the fixed
mindset, great geniuses are not supposed to need it.
So just needing it casts a shadow on your ability. The
second is that, as Nadja suggests, it robs you of all
your excuses. Without effort, you can always say, “I
could have been [fill in the blank].” But once you try,
you can’t say that anymore. Someone once said to
me, “I could have been Yo-Yo Ma.” If she had really
tried for it, she wouldn't have been able to say that.

Salerno-Sonnenberg was terrified of losing DeLay.
She finally decided that trying and failing—an hon-
est failure—was better than the course she had been
on, and so she began training with DeLay for an up-
coming competition. For the first time she went all
out, and, by the way, won. Now she says, “This is
something I know for a fact: You have to work hard-
est for the things you love most. And when it’s music
you love, you’re in for the fight of your life.”

Fear of effort can happen in relationships, too, as
it did with Amanda, a dynamic and attractive young
woman.

Thad a lot of crazy boyfriends. A lot. They
ranged from unreliable to inconsiderate.
“How about a nice guy for once?” my best
friend Carla always said. It was like, “You de-
serve better.”

So then Carla fixed me up with Rob, a guy
from her office. He was great, and not just on
day one. I loved it. It was like, “Oh, my God,
a guy who actually shows up on time.” Then
it became serious and I freaked. I mean,
this guy really liked me, but I couldn't stop

thinking about how, if he really knew me,
he might get turned off. I mean, what if I
really, really tried and it didn't work? I guess
Icouldn’t take that risk.

Low Effort: The Big Risk

In the growth mindset, it’s almost inconceivable to
want something badly, to think you have a chance
to achieve it, and then do nothing about it. When it
happens, the J could have been is heartbreaking, not
comforting.

There were few American women in the 1930s
through 1950s who were more successful than Clare
Boothe Luce. She was a famous author and play-
wright, she was elected to Congress twice, and she
was ambassador to Italy. “I don’t really understand
the word ‘success,”” she has said. “I know people use
it about me, but I don’t understand it.” Her public life
and private tragedies kept her from getting back to
her greatest love: writing for the theater. She’d had
great success with plays like The Women, but it just
wouldn't do for a political figure to keep penning
tart, sexy comedies.

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

For her, politics did not provide the personal cre-
ative effort she valued most, and looking back she
couldn't forgive herself for not pursuing her passion
for theater. “I often thought,” she said, “that if 1 were
to write an autobiography, my title would be The
Autobiography of a Failure.”

Billie Jean King says it’s all about what you want
to look back and say. I agree with her. You can look
back and say, “I could have been...,” polishing your
unused endowments like trophies. Or you can look
back and say, “I gave my all for the things I valued.”
Think about what you want to look back and say.
Then choose your mindset.

Turning Knowledge into Action

Sure, people with the fixed mindset have read the
books that say: Success is about being your best
self, not about being better than others; failure is an
opportunity, not a condemnation; effort is the key
to success. But they can’t put this into practice be-
cause their basic mindset—their belief in fixed traits
—is telling them something entirely different: that
success is about being more gifted than others, that

failure does measure you, and that effort is for those
who can’t make it on talent.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.

At this point, you probably have questions. Let me
see if [can answer some of them.

Question: If people believe their qualities are
(fixed, and they have shown themselves to be
smart or talented, why do they have to keep
proving it? After all, when the prince proved
his bravery, he and the princess lived happily
ever after. He didn’t have to go out and slay a
dragon every day. Why don’t people with the
fixed mindset prove themselves and then live
happily ever after?

Because every day new and larger dragons come
along and, as things get harder, maybe the abil-
ity they proved yesterday is not up to today’s task.
Maybe they were smart enough for algebra but not
calculus. Maybe they were a good enough pitcher for

the minor leagues but not the majors, Maybe they
were a good enough writer for their school news-
paper but not The New York Times.

So they're racing to prove themselves over and
over, but where are they going? To me they’re often
running in place, amassing countless affirmations,
but not necessarily ending up where they want to be.

You know those movies where the main character
wakes up one day and sees that his life has not been
worthwhile—he has always been besting people, not
growing, learning, or caring. My favorite is Ground-
hog Day, which I didn’t see for a long time because I
couldn't get past the name. At any rate, in Groundhog
Day, Bill Murray doesn’t just wake up one day and get
the message; he has to repeat the same day over and
over until he gets the message.

Phil Connors (Murray) is a weatherman for a local
station in Pittsburgh who is dispatched to Punx-
sutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the Groundhog
Day ceremony. On February 2, a groundhog is taken
out of his little house; if he is judged to have seen his
shadow, there will be another six weeks of winter. If
not, there will be an early spring.

Phil, considering himself to be a superior being,
has complete contempt for the ceremony, the town,
and the people (“hicks” and “morons”), and after
making that perfectly clear, he plans to get out of
Punxsutawney as quickly as possible. But this is not
to be. A blizzard hits the town, he is forced to re-
main, and when he wakes up the next morning, it’s
Groundhog Day again. The same Sonny and Cher
song, “I Got You Babe,” wakes him up on the clock
radio and the same groundhog festival is gearing up
once again. And again. And again.

At first, he uses the knowledge to further his typ-
ical agenda, making fools out of other people. Since
he is the only one reliving the day, he can talk to a
woman on one day, and then use the information to
deceive, impress, and seduce her the next. He is in
fixed-mindset heaven. He can prove his superiority
over and over.

But after countless such days, he realizes it’s all
going nowhere and he tries to kill himself. He
crashes a car, he electrocutes himself, he jumps from
a steeple, he walks in front of a truck. With no way
out, it finally dawns on him. He could be using this
time to learn. He goes for piano lessons. He reads

voraciously. He learns ice sculpting. He finds out
about people who need help that day (a boy who
falls from a tree, a man who chokes on his steak)
and starts to help them, and care about them. Pretty
soon the day is not long enough! Only when this
change of mindset is complete is he released from
the spell.

Question: Are mindsets a permanent part of
‘your makeup or can you change them?

Mindsets are an important part of your person-
ality, but you can change them. Just by knowing
about the two mindsets, you can start thinking and
reacting in new ways. People tell me they start to
catch themselves when they are in the throes of
the fixed mindset—passing up a chance for learning,
feeling labeled by a failure, or getting discouraged
when something requires a lot of effort. And then
they switch themselves into the growth mindset—
making sure they take the challenge, learn from the
failure, or continue their effort. When my graduate
students and I first discovered the mindsets, they

would catch me in the fixed mindset, smile kindly,
and let me know it.

It’s also important to realize that even if people
have a fixed mindset, they’re not always in that
mindset. In fact, in many of our studies, we put
people into a growth mindset. We tell them that an
ability can be learned and that the task will give
them a chance to do that. Or we have them read a sci-
entific article that teaches them the growth mind-
set. The article describes people who did not have
natural ability, but who developed exceptional skills.
These experiences make our research participants
into growth-minded thinkers, at least for the mo-
ment—and they act like growth-minded thinkers,
too.

Later, there’s a chapter all about change. There I de-
scribe people who have changed and programs we've
developed to bring about change.

Question: Can I be half-and-half? I recognize
both mindsets in myself.

All of us have elements of both—we’re all a mix-
ture of fixed and growth mindsets. I’m talking about

it as a simple either-or right now for the sake of
simplicity.

People can also have different mindsets in different
areas. I might think that my artistic skills are fixed
but that my intelligence can be developed. Or that
my personality is fixed, but my creativity can be de-
veloped. We've found that whatever mindset people
have ina particular area will guide them in that area.

Question: With all your belief in effort, are you
saying that when people fail, it's always their
fault—they didn’t try hard enough?

No! It’s true that effort is crucial—no one can suc-
ceed for long without it—but it’s certainly not the
only thing. People have different resources and op-
portunities. For example, people with money (or rich
parents) have a safety net. They can take more risks
and keep going longer until they succeed. People
with easy access to a good education, people with
a network of influential friends, people who know
how to be in the right place at the right time—all
stand a better chance of having their effort pay off.
Rich, educated, connected effort works better.

People with fewer resources, in spite of their best
efforts, can be derailed so much more easily. The
hometown plant you've worked in all of your life
suddenly shuts down. What now? Your child falls
ill and plunges you into debt. There goes the house.
Your spouse runs off with the nest egg and leaves
you with the children and bills. Forget the night
school classes.

Before we judge, let’s remember that effort isn't
quite everything and that all effort is not created
equal.

Question: You keep talking about how the
growth mindset makes people number one,
the best, the most successful. Isn’t the growth
mindset about personal development, not
besting others?

Iuse examples of people who made it to the top to
show how far the growth mindset can take you: Be-
lieving talents can be developed allows people to ful-
fill their potential.

In addition, examples of laid-back people having
a good time would not be as convincing to people

with a fixed mindset. It doesn’t provide a compelling
alternative for them because it makes it look like a
choice between fun and excellence.

However, this point is crucial: The growth mindset
does allow people to love what they’re doing—and
to continue to love it in the face of difficulties. The
growth-minded athletes, CEOs, musicians, or scien-
tists all loved what they did, whereas many of the
fixed-minded ones did not.

Many growth-minded people didn’t even plan to
go to the top. They got there as a result of doing
what they love. It’s ironic: The top is where the
fixed-mindset people hunger to be, but it's where
many growth-minded people arrive as a by-product
of their enthusiasm for what they do.

This point is also crucial. In the fixed mindset,
everything is about the outcome. If you fail—or if
you're not the best—it’s all been wasted. The growth
mindset allows people to value what they’re doing
regardless of the outcome. They're tackling problems,
charting new courses, working on important issues.
Maybe they haven't found the cure for cancer, but
the search was deeply meaningful.

A lawyer spent seven years fighting the biggest

that just because I spent seven years on something

Question: I know a lot of workaholics on the

that people with a fixed mindset go in for low

On the whole, people with a fixed mindset prefer
effortless success, since that’s the best way to prove
their talent. But you're right, there are also plenty of
high-powered people who think their traits are fixed
and are looking for constant validation. These may

or become the richest person on the planet—and
they’re willing to do what it takes. We'll meet people
like this in the chapter on business and leadership.
These people may be free of the belief that high
effort equals low ability, but they have the other
parts of the fixed mindset. They may constantly put
their talent on display. They may feel that their tal-
ent makes them superior to other people. And they
may be intolerant of mistakes, criticism, or setbacks.
Incidentally, people with a growth mindset might
also like a Nobel Prize or a lot of money. But they
are not seeking it as a validation of their worth or as
something that will make them better than others.

Question: What if I like my fixed mindset? If I
know what my abilities and talents are, I know
where I stand, and I know what to expect. Why
should I give that up?

If you like it, by all means keep it. This book shows
people they have a choice by spelling out the two
mindsets and the worlds they create. The point is
that people can choose which world they want to
inhabit.

The fixed mindset creates the feeling that you can
really know the permanent truth about yourself.
And this can be comforting: You don't have to try
for such-and-such because you don’t have the talent.
You will surely succeed at thus-and-such because
you do have the talent.

It’s just important to be aware of the drawbacks
of this mindset. You may be robbing yourself of an
opportunity by underestimating your talent in the
first area. Or you may be undermining your chances
of success in the second area by assuming that your
talent alone will take you there.

By the way, having a growth mindset doesn't force
you to pursue something. It just tells you that you
can develop your skills. It’s still up to you whether
you want to.

Question: Can everything about people be
changed, and should people try to change
everything they can?

The growth mindset is the belief that abilities
can be cultivated. But it doesn’t tell you how much
change is possible or how long change will take. And

it doesn’t mean that everything, like preferences or
values, can be changed.

I was once in a taxi, and the driver had an opera
on the radio. Thinking to start a conversation, I said,
“Do you like opera?” “No,” he replied, “I hate it. 've
always hated don’t mean to pry,” I said, “but
why are you listening to it?” He then told me how
his father had been an opera buff, listening to his
vintage records at every opportunity. My cabdriver,
now well into middle age, had tried for many years
to cultivate a rapturous response to opera. He played
the disks, he read the scores—all to no avail. “Give
yourself a break,” I advised him. “There are plenty
of cultured and intelligent people who can't stand
opera. Why don’t you just consider yourself one of
them?”

The growth mindset also doesn't mean everything
that can be changed should be changed. We all need
to accept some of our imperfections, especially the
ones that don’t really harm our lives or the lives of
others.

The fixed mindset stands in the way of develop-
ment and change. The growth mindset is a starting
point for change, but people need to decide for them-

selves where their efforts toward change would be
most valuable.

Question: Are people with the fixed mindset
simply lacking in confidence?

No. People with the fixed mindset can have just as
much confidence as people with the growth mindset
—before anything happens, that is. But as you can
imagine, their confidence is more fragile since set-
backs and even effort can undermine it.

Joseph Martocchio conducted a study of employees
who were taking a short computer training course.
Half of the employees were put into a fixed mindset.
He told them it was all a matter of how much ability
they possessed. The other half were put in a growth
mindset. He told them that computer skills could
be developed through practice. Everyone, steeped in
these mindsets, then proceeded with the course.

Although the two groups started off with exactly
equal confidence in their computer skills, by the end
of the course they looked quite different. Those in
the growth mindset gained considerable confidence
in their computer skills as they learned, despite the

many mistakes they inevitably made. But, because
of those mistakes, those with the fixed mindset ac-
tually lost confidence in their computer skills as they
learned!

The same thing happened with Berkeley students.
Richard Robins and Jennifer Pals tracked students
at the University of California at Berkeley over their
years of college. They found that when students
had the growth mindset, they gained confidence in
themselves as they repeatedly met and mastered
the challenges of the university. However, when stu-
dents had the fixed mindset, their confidence eroded
in the face of those same challenges.

That’s why people with the fixed mindset have to
nurse their confidence and protect it. That’s what
John McEnroe’s excuses were for: to protect his con-
fidence.

against superior competition could hurt her long-

don't win,” warned Vijay Singh, a prominent golfer
onthe tour.

But Wie disagreed. She wasn’t going there to
groom her confidence. “Once you win junior tour-
naments, it’s easy to win multiple times. What I’m
doing now is to prepare for the future.” It’s the learn-
ing experience she was after—what it was like to
play with the world’s best players in the atmosphere
of a tournament.

After the event, Wie’s confidence had not suffered
one bit. She had exactly what she wanted. “I think I
learned that I can play here.” It would be a long road
to the winner's circle, but she now had a sense of
what she was shooting for.

A remarkable thing I’ve learned from my research
is that in the growth mindset, you don’t always need
confidence.

What I mean is that even when you think you're
not good at something, you can still plunge into it
wholeheartedly and stick to it. Actually, sometimes
you plunge into something because you're not good
atit. This is a wonderful feature of the growth mind-

set. You don’t have to think you're already great at
something to want to do it and to enjoy doing it.

This book is one of the hardest things I've ever
done. I read endless books and articles. The infor-
mation was overwhelming. I'd never written in a
popular way. It was intimidating. Does it seem easy
for me? Way back when, that’s exactly what I would
have wanted you to think. Now I want you to know
the effort it took—and the joy it brought.

Grow Your Mindset

learning, but the fixed mindset
can undo it. Think of a time you
were enjoying something—doing
acrossword puzzle, playing a
sport, learning a new dance. Then
it became hard and you wanted
out. Maybe you suddenly felt tired,
dizzy, bored, or hungry. Next time
this happens, don't fool yourself. It’s

THE TRUTH ABOUT ABILITY
AND ACCOMPLISHMENT

Try to picture Thomas Edison as vividly as you can.
Think about where he is and what he’s doing. Is he
alone? I asked people, and they always said things
like this:

“He's in his workshop surrounded by equipment.
He's working on the phonograph, trying things. He
succeeds! [Is he alone?] Yes, he’s doing this stuff
alone because he’s the only one who knows what he’s
after.”

“He's in New Jersey. He's standing in a white coat in
a lab-type room. He's leaning over a lightbulb. Sud-
denly, it works! [Is he alone?] Yes. He's kind of a reclu-
sive guy who likes to tinker on his own.”

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

In truth, the record shows quite a different fellow,
working in quite a different way.

Edison was not a loner. For the invention of the
lightbulb, he had thirty assistants, including well-
trained scientists, often working around the clock in
acorporate-funded state-of-the-art laboratory!

It did not happen suddenly. The lightbulb has be-
come the symbol of that single moment when the
brilliant solution strikes, but there was no single
moment of invention. In fact, the lightbulb was not
one invention, but a whole network of time-consum-
ing inventions each requiring one or more chemists,
mathematicians, physicists, engineers, and glass-
blowers.

Edison was no naive tinkerer or unworldly egg-
head. The “Wizard of Menlo Park” was a savvy entre-
preneur, fully aware of the commercial potential of
his inventions. He also knew how to cozy up to the
press—sometimes beating others out as the inventor
of something because he knew how to publicize
himself.

Yes, he was a genius. But he was not always one.
His biographer, Paul Israel, sifting through all the
available information, thinks he was more or less

a regular boy of his time and place. Young Tom
was taken with experiments and mechanical things
(perhaps more avidly than most), but machines and
technology were part of the ordinary midwestern
boy's experience.

What eventually set him apart was his mindset
and drive. He never stopped being the curious, tin-
kering boy looking for new challenges. Long after
other young men had taken up their roles in society,
he rode the rails from city to city learning every-
thing he could about telegraphy, and working his
way up the ladder of telegraphers through nonstop
self-education and invention. And later, much to the
disappointment of his wives, his consuming love re-
mained self-improvement and invention, but only
in his field.

There are many myths about ability and achieve-
ment, especially about the lone, brilliant person sud-
denly producing amazing things.

Yet Darwin's masterwork, The Origin of Species,
took years of teamwork in the field, hundreds of dis-
cussions with colleagues and mentors, several pre-
liminary drafts, and half a lifetime of dedication be-
fore it reached fruition.

Mozart labored for more than ten years until he
produced any work that we admire today. Before
then, his compositions were not that original or
interesting. Actually, they were often patched-to-
gether chunks taken from other composers.

This chapter is about the real ingredients in
achievement. It’s about why some people achieve
less than expected and why some people achieve
more.

MINDSET AND SCHOOL ACHIEVEMENT

Let’s step down from the celestial realm of Mozart
and Darwin and come back to earth to see how
mindsets create achievement in real life. It’s funny,
but seeing one student blossom under the growth
mindset has a greater impact on me than all the
stories about Mozarts and Darwins. Maybe because
it's more about you and me—about what’s happened
to us and why we are where we are now. And about
children and their potential.

Back on earth, we measured students’ mindsets as
they made the transition to junior high school: Did

they believe their intelligence was a fixed trait or
something they could develop? Then we followed
them for the next two years.

The transition to junior high is a time of great
challenge for many students. The work gets much
harder, the grading policies toughen up, the teach-
ing becomes less personalized. And all this happens
while students are coping with their new adolescent
bodies and roles, Grades suffer, but not everyone's
grades suffer equally.

No. In our study, only the students with the fixed
mindset showed the decline. The students with the
growth mindset showed an increase in their grades
over the two years.

When the two groups had entered junior high,
their past records were indistinguishable. In the
more benign environment of grade school, they’d
earned the same grades and achievement test scores.
Only when they hit the challenge of junior high did
they begin to pull apart.

Here's how students with the fixed mindset ex-
plained their poor grades. Many maligned their abil-
ities: “I am the stupidest” or “I suck in math.” And
many covered these feelings by blaming someone

else: “[The math teacher] is a fat male slut...and [the
English teacher] is a slob with a pink ass.” “Because
the teacher is on crack.” These interesting analyses
of the problem hardly provide a road map to future
success.

With the threat of failure looming, students with
the growth mindset instead mobilized their re-
sources for learning. They told us that they, too,
sometimes felt overwhelmed, but their response
was to dig in and do what it takes. They were like
George Dantzig. Who?

George Dantzig was a graduate student in math at
Berkeley. One day, as usual, he rushed in late to his
math class and quickly copied the two homework
problems from the blackboard. When he later went
to do them, he found them very difficult, and it took
him several days of hard work to crack them open
and solve them. They turned out not to be home-
work problems at all. They were two famous math
problems that had never been solved.

The Low-Effort Syndrome

facing the hard transition saw it as a threat. It threat-
ened to unmask their flaws and turn them from win-
ners into losers. In fact, in the fixed mindset, adoles-
cence is one big test. Am I smart or dumb? Am I good-
looking or ugly? Am I cool or nerdy? Am I a winner or a
loser? And in the fixed mindset, a loser is forever.

It's no wonder that many adolescents mobilize
their resources, not for learning, but to protect their
egos. And one of the main ways they do this (aside
from providing vivid portraits of their teachers) is
by not trying. This is when some of the brightest
students, just like Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, sim-
ply stop working. In fact, students with the fixed
mindset tell us that their main goal in school—aside
from looking smart—is to exert as little effort as pos-
sible. They heartily agree with statements like this:

“In school my main goal is to do things as easily as
possible so I don’t have to work very hard.”

This low-effort syndrome is often seen as a way
that adolescents assert their independence from
adults, but it is also a way that students with the
fixed mindset protect themselves. They view the
adults as saying, “Now we will measure you and see

what you've got.” And they are answering, “No you
won't.”

John Holt, the great educator, says that these are
the games all human beings play when others are
sitting in judgment of them. “The worst student we
had, the worst I have ever encountered, was in his
life outside the classroom as mature, intelligent, and
interesting a person as anyone at the school. What
went wrong?...Somewhere along the line, his intelli-
gence became disconnected from his schooling.”

For students with the growth mindset, it doesn’t
make sense to stop trying. For them, adolescence is a
time of opportunity: a time to learn new subjects, a
time to find out what they like and what they want
to become in the future.

Later, I'll describe the project in which we taught
junior high students the growth mindset. What I
want to tell you now is how teaching them this
mindset unleashed their effort. One day, we were
introducing the growth mindset to a new group of
students. All at once Jimmy—the most hard-core
turned-off low-effort kid in the group—looked up
with tears in his eyes and said, “You mean I don’t
have to be dumb?” From that day on, he worked. He

started staying up late to do his homework, which
he never used to bother with at all. He started hand-
ing in assignments early so he could get feedback
and revise them. He now believed that working hard
was not something that made you vulnerable, but
something that made you smarter.

Finding Your Brain

A close friend of mine recently handed me some-
thing he’d written, a poem-story that reminded me
of Jimmy and his unleashed effort. My friend’s sec-
ond-grade teacher, Mrs. Beer, had had each student
draw and cut out a paper horse. She then lined up
all the horses above the blackboard and delivered her
growth-mindset message: “Your horse is only as fast
as your brain. Every time you learn something, your
horse will move ahead.”

My friend wasn’t so sure about the “brain” thing.
His father had always told him, “You have too much
mouth and too little brains for your own good.” Plus,
his horse seemed to just sit at the starting gate while
“everyone else’s brain joined the learning chase,”
especially the brains of Hank and Billy, the class ge-

niuses, whose horses jumped way ahead of every-
one else's. But my friend kept at it. To improve his
skills, he kept reading the comics with his mother
and he kept adding up the points when he played gin
rummy with his grandmother.

Of course, learning shouldn't really be a race. But
this race helped my friend discover his brain and
connect it up to his schooling.

The College Transition

Another transition, another crisis. College is when
all the students who were the brains in high school
are thrown together. Like our graduate students,
yesterday they were king of the hill, but today who
are they?

Nowhere is the anxiety of being dethroned more
palpable than in pre-med classes. In the last chap-
ter, I mentioned our study of tense but hopeful
undergraduates taking their first college chemistry
course. This is the course that would give them—or
deny them—entrée to the pre-med curriculum, and
it’s well known that students will go to almost any
lengths to do well in this course.

‘At the beginning of the semester, we measured
students’ mindsets, and then we followed them
through the course, watching their grades and ask-
ing about their study strategies. Once again we
found that the students with the growth mindset

earned better grades in the course. Even when they
did poorly on a particular test, they bounced back on
the next ones. When students with the fixed mind-
set did poorly, they often didn’t make a comeback.

In this course, everybody studied. But there are
different ways to study. Many students study like
this: They read the textbook and their class notes.
If the material is really hard, they read them again.
Or they might try to memorize everything they can,
like a vacuum cleaner. That’s how the students with
the fixed mindset studied. If they did poorly on the
test, they concluded that chemistry was not their
subject. After all, “I did everything possible, didn’t
rR”

Far from it. They would be shocked to find out
what students with the growth mindset do. Even I
find it remarkable.

The students with growth mindset completely
took charge of their learning and motivation. In-
stead of plunging into unthinking memorization of
the course material, they said: “I looked for themes
and underlying principles across lectures,” and “I
went over mistakes until I was certain I understood
them.” They were studying to learn, not just to ace

the test. And, actually, this was why they got higher
grades—not because they were smarter or had a bet-
ter background in science.

Instead of losing their motivation when the course
got dry or difficult, they said: “I maintained my
interest in the material.” “I stayed positive about tak-
ing chemistry.” “I kept myself motivated to study.”
Even if they thought the textbook was boring or the
instructor was a stiff, they didn’t let their motiv-
ation evaporate. That just made it all the more im-
portant to motivate themselves.

I got an e-mail from one of my undergraduate
students shortly after I had taught her the growth
mindset. Here’s how she used to study before:
“When faced with really tough material I tend[ed] to.
read the material over and over.” After learning the
growth mindset, she started using better strategies
—that worked:

one, perhaps the most valuable I’ve learned

Because they think in terms of learning, people
with the growth mindset are clued in to all the
different ways to create learning. It’s odd. Our pre-
med students with the fixed mindset would do al-
most anything for a good grade—except take charge
of the process to make sure it happens.

Created Equal?

Does this mean that anyone with the right mindset
can do well? Are all children created equal? Let's
take the second question first. No, some children
are different. In her book Gifted Children, Ellen Win-
ner offers incredible descriptions of prodigies. These
are children who seem to be born with heightened
abilities and obsessive interests, and who, through
relentless pursuit of these interests, become amaz-
ingly accomplished.

Michael was one of the most precocious. He con-
stantly played games involving letters and numbers,
made his parents answer endless questions about
letters and numbers, and spoke, read, and did math
at an unbelievably early age. Michael's mother re-
ports that at four months old, he said, “Mom, Dad,
what's for dinner?” At ten months, he astounded
people in the supermarket by reading words from
the signs. Everyone assumed his mother was doing
some kind of ventriloquism thing. His father reports
that at three, he was not only doing algebra, but
discovering and proving algebraic rules. Each day,

when his father got home from work, Michael would
pull him toward math books and say, “Dad, let’s go
do work.”

Michael must have started with a special ability,
but, for me, the most outstanding feature is his
extreme love of learning and challenge. His parents
could not tear him away from his demanding activ-
ities. The same is true for every prodigy Winner de-
scribes. Most often people believe that the “gift” is
the ability itself. Yet what feeds it is that constant,
endless curiosity and challenge seeking.

Is it ability or mindset? Was it Mozart’s musical
ability or the fact that he worked till his hands were
deformed? Was it Darwin's scientific ability or the
fact that he collected specimens nonstop from early
childhood?

Prodigies or not, we all have interests that can
blossom into abilities. As a child, I was fascinated
by people, especially adults. I wondered: What makes
them tick? In fact, afew years back, one of my cousins
reminded me of an episode that took place when we
were five years old. We were at my grandmother's
house, and he'd had a big fight with his mother over
when he could eat his candy. Later, we were sitting

outside on the front steps and I said to him: “Don’t be
so stupid. Adults like to think they’re in charge. Just
say yes, and then eat your candy when you want to.”

Were those the words of a budding psychologist?
All I know is that my cousin told me this advice
served him well. (Interestingly, he became a dentist.)

Can Everyone Do Well?

Now back to the first question. Is everyone capable
of great things with the right mindset? Could you
march into the worst high school in your state and
teach the students college calculus? If you could,
then one thing would be clear: With the right mind-
set and the right teaching, people are capable of a lot
more than we think.

Garfield High School was one of the worst schools
in Los Angeles. To say that the students were turned
off and the teachers burned out is an understate-
ment, But without thinking twice, Jaime Escalante
(of Stand and Deliver fame) taught these inner-city
Hispanic students college-level calculus. With his
growth mindset, he asked, “How can I teach them?”

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

not “Can I teach them?” and “How will they learn
best?” not “Can they learn?”

But not only did he teach them calculus, he (and
his colleague, Benjamin Jimenez) took them to the
top of the national charts in math. In 1987, only
three other public schools in the country had more
students taking the Advanced Placement Calculus
test. Those three included Stuyvesant High School
and the Bronx High School of Science, both elite
math-and-science-oriented schools in New York.

What's more, most of the Garfield students earned
test grades that were high enough to gain them col-
lege credits. In the whole country that year, only a
few hundred Mexican American students passed the
test at this level. This means there's a lot of intel-
ligence out there being wasted by underestimating
students’ potential to develop.

Marva Collins

Most often when kids are behind—say, when they're
repeating a grade—they’re given dumbed-down ma-
terial on the assumption that they can’t handle
more. That idea comes from the fixed mindset:

reste 44 min danse chapive 2%


==================================================
Page 129
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

These students are dim-witted, so they need the
same simple things drummed into them over and
over. Well, the results are depressing. Students re-
peat the whole grade without learning any more than
they knew before.

Instead, Marva Collins took inner-city Chicago kids
who had failed in the public schools and treated
them like geniuses. Many of them had been labeled
“learning disabled,” “retarded,” or “emotionally dis-
turbed.” Virtually all of them were apathetic. No
light in the eyes, no hope in the face.

Collins's second-grade public school class started
out with the lowest-level reader there was. By June,
they reached the middle of the fifth-grade reader,
studying Aristotle, Aesop, Tolstoy, Shakespeare, Poe,
Frost, and Dickinson along the way.

Later when she started her own school, Chicago
Sun-Times columnist Zay Smith dropped in. He saw
four-year-olds writing sentences like “See the phys-
ician” and “Aesop wrote fables,” and talking about
“diphthongs” and “diacritical marks.” He observed
second graders reciting passages from Shakespeare,
Longfellow, and Kipling. Shortly before, he had
visited a rich suburban high school where many stu-

dents had never heard of Shakespeare. “Shoot,” said
one of Collins's students, “you mean those rich high
school kids don’t know Shakespeare was born in
1564 and died in 16162”

Students read huge amounts, even over the sum-
mer. One student, who had entered as a “retarded”
six-year-old, now four years later had read twenty-
three books over the summer, including A Tale of
Two Cities and Jane Eyre. The students read deeply
and thoughtfully. As the three- and four-year-olds
were reading about Daedalus and Icarus, one four-
year-old exclaimed, “Mrs. Collins, if we do not learn
and work hard, we will take an Icarian flight to no-
where.” Heated discussions of Macbeth were com-
mon.

Alfred Binet believed you could change the qual-
ity of someone's mind. Clearly you can. Whether
you measure these children by the breadth of their
knowledge or by their performance on standardized
tests, their minds had been transformed.

Benjamin Bloom, an eminent educational re-
searcher, studied 120 outstanding achievers. They
were concert pianists, sculptors, Olympic swim-
mers, world-class tennis players, mathematicians,

and research neurologists. Most were not that re-
markable as children and didn’t show clear tal-
ent before their training began in earnest. Even by
early adolescence, you usually couldn’t predict their
future accomplishment from their current ability.
Only their continued motivation and commitment,
along with their network of support, took them to
the top.

Bloom concludes, “After forty years of intensive re-
search on school learning in the United States as well
as abroad, my major conclusion is: What any person
in the world can learn, almost all persons can learn,
if provided with the appropriate prior and current
conditions of learning.” He's not counting the 2 to
3 percent of children who have severe impairments,
and he’s not counting the top 1 to 2 percent of chil-
dren at the other extreme that include children like
Michael. He is counting everybody else.

Ability Levels and Tracking

But aren't students sorted into different ability levels
for a reason? Haven't their test scores and past
achievement shown what their ability is? Remem-

ber, test scores and measures of achievement tell you
where a student is, but they don’t tell you where a
student could end up.

Falko Rheinberg, a researcher in Germany, studied
schoolteachers with different mindsets. Some of the
teachers had the fixed mindset. They believed that
students entering their class with different achieve-
ment levels were deeply and permanently different:

“according to my experience students’ achieve-
ment mostly remains constant in the course of a
year.”

“If 1 know students’ intelligence I can predict their
school career quite well.”

“Asa teacher I have no influence on students’ intel-
lectual ability.”

Like my sixth-grade teacher, Mrs. Wilson, these
teachers preached and practiced the fixed mindset.
In their classrooms, the students who started the
year in the high-ability group ended the year there,
and those who started the year in the low-ability
group ended the year there.

But some teachers preached and practiced a
growth mindset. They focused on the idea that
all children could develop their skills, and in their

classrooms a weird thing happened. It didn’t matter
whether students started the year in the high- or the
low-ability group. Both groups ended the year way
up high. It’s a powerful experience to see these find-
ings. The group differences had simply disappeared
under the guidance of teachers who taught for im-
provement, for these teachers had found a way to
reach their “low-ability” students.

How teachers put a growth mindset into practice
is the topic of a later chapter, but here's a preview of
how Marva Collins, the renowned teacher, did it. On
the first day of class, she approached Freddie, a left-
back second grader, who wanted no part of school.

Summary

The fixed mindset limits achievement. It fills
people's minds with interfering thoughts, it makes
effort disagreeable, and it leads to inferior learn-

ing strategies. What’s more, it makes other people
into judges instead of allies. Whether we're talk-
ing about Darwin or college students, important
achievements require a clear focus, all-out effort,
and a bottomless trunk full of strategies. Plus allies
in learning. This is what the growth mindset gives
people, and that’s why it helps their abilities grow
and bear fruit.

IS ARTISTIC ABILITY A GIFT?

Despite the widespread belief that intelligence is
born, not made, when we really think about it, it’s
not so hard to imagine that people can develop their
intellectual abilities. The intellect is so multifaceted.
You can develop verbal skills or mathematical-scien-
tific skills or logical thinking skills, and so on. But
when it comes to artistic ability, it seems more like
a God-given gift. For example, people seem to natur-
ally draw well or poorly.

Even I believed this. While some of my friends
seemed to draw beautifully with no effort and no
training, my drawing ability was arrested in early
grade school. Try as I might, my attempts were

primitive and disappointing. I was artistic in other
ways. I can design, I'm great with colors, I have a
subtle sense of composition. Plus I have really good
eye-hand coordination. Why couldn't I draw? Imust
not have the gift.

I have to admit that it didn’t bother me all that
much. After all, when do you really have to draw? I
found out one evening as the dinner guest of a fas-
cinating man. He was an older man, a psychiatrist,
who had escaped from the Holocaust. As a ten-
year-old child in Czechoslovakia, he and his younger
brother came home from school one day to find their
parents gone. They had been taken. Knowing there
was an uncle in England, the two boys walked to
London and found him.

A few years later, lying about his age, my host
joined the Royal Air Force and fought for Britain
in the war. When he was wounded, he married his
nurse, went to medical school, and established a
thriving practice in America.

Over the years, he developed a great interest in
owls. He thought of them as embodying character-
istics he admired, and he liked to think of him-
self as owlish. Besides the many owl statuettes that

adorned his house, he had an owl-related guest
book. It turned out that whenever he took a shine to
someone, he asked them to draw an owl and write
something to him in this book. As he extended this
book to me and explained its significance, I felt both
honored and horrified. Mostly horrified. All the more
because my creation was not to be buried some-
where in the middle of the book, but was to adorn its
very last page.

I won't dwell on the intensity of my discomfort or
the poor quality of my artwork, although both were
painfully clear. I tell this story as a prelude to the
astonishment and joy I felt when I read Drawing on
the Right Side of the Brain. Below are the before-and-
after self-portraits of people who took a short course
in drawing from the author, Betty Edwards. That
is, they are the self-portraits drawn by the students
when they entered her course and five days later
when they had completed it.

Aren't they amazing? At the beginning, these
people didn’t look as though they had much artis-
tic ability. Most of their pictures reminded me of
my owl. But only a few days later, everybody could

Edwards agrees that most people view drawing as
a magical ability that only a select few possess, and
that only a select few will ever possess. But this
is because people don’t understand the components
—the learnable components—of drawing. Actually,
she informs us, they are not drawing skills at all, but
seeing skills. They are the ability to perceive edges,
spaces, relationships, lights and shadows, and the
whole. Drawing requires us to learn each component
skill and then combine them into one process. Some
people simply pick up these skills in the natural
course of their lives, whereas others have to work to
learn them and put them together. But as we can see
from the “after” self-portraits, everyone can do it.
Here's what this means: Just because some people
can do something with little or no training, it doesn’t
mean that others can’t do it (and sometimes do it even
better) with training. This is so important, because
many, many people with the fixed mindset think
that someone's early performance tells you all you
need to know about their talent and their future.

Jackson Pollock

It would have been a real shame if people discour-
aged Jackson Pollock for that reason. Experts agree
that Pollock had little native talent for art, and when
you look at his early products, it showed. They also
agree that he became one of the greatest American
painters of the twentieth century and that he revolu-
tionized modern art. How did he go from point A to
point B?

Twyla Tharp, the world-famous choreographer
and dancer, wrote a book called The Creative Habit.
‘As you can guess from the title, she argues that
creativity is not a magical act of inspiration. It's the
result of hard work and dedication. Even for Moz-
art. Remember the movie Amadeus? Remember how
it showed Mozart easily churning out one master-
piece after another while Salieri, his rival, is dying
of envy? Well, Tharp worked on that movie and she
says: Hogwash! Nonsense! “There are no ‘natural’ ge-
niuses.”

Dedication is how Jackson Pollock got from point A
to point B. Pollock was wildly in love with the idea

of being an artist. He thought about art all the time,
and he did it all the time. Because he was so gung ho,
he got others to take him seriously and mentor him
until he mastered all there was to master and began
to produce startlingly original works. His “poured”
paintings, each completely unique, allowed him to
draw from his unconscious mind and convey a huge
range of feeling, Several years ago, I was privileged to
see a show of these paintings at the Museum of Mod-
ern Art in New York. I was stunned by the power and
beauty of each work.

Can anyone do anything? I don’t really know. How-
ever, I think we can now agree that people can do a
lot more than first meets the eye.

THE DANGER OF PRAISE AND POSITIVE LABELS

If people have such potential to achieve, how can
they gain faith in their potential? How can we give
them the confidence they need to go for it? How
about praising their ability in order to convey that
they have what it takes? In fact, more than 80 per-
cent of parents told us it was necessary to praise

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

children’s ability so as to foster their confidence and
achievement. You know, it makes a lot of sense.

But then we began to worry. We thought about
how people with the fixed mindset already focus too
much on their ability: “Is it high enough?” “Will it
look good?” Wouldn't praising people's ability focus
them on it even more? Wouldn't it be telling them
that that’s what we value and, even worse, that we
can read their deep, underlying ability from their
performance? Isn’t that teaching them the fixed
mindset?

Adam Guettel has been called the crown prince
and savior of musical theater. He is the grandson
of Richard Rodgers, the man who wrote the music
to such classics as Oklahoma! and Carousel. Guettel’s
mother gushes about her son's genius. So does every-
one else. “The talent is there and it’s major,” raved
a review in The New York Times. The question is
whether this kind of praise encourages people.

What's great about research is that you can ask
these kinds of questions and then go get the an-
swers. So we conducted studies with hundreds of
students, mostly early adolescents. We first gave
each student a set of ten fairly difficult problems

from a nonverbal IQ test. They mostly did pretty well
on these, and when they finished we praised them.

We praised some of the students for their ability.
They were told: “Wow, you got [say] eight right.
That’s a really good score. You must be smart at this.”
They were in the Adam Guettel you’re-so-talented
position.

We praised other students for their effort: “Wow,
you got [say] eight right. That’s a really good score.
You must have worked really hard.” They were not
made to feel that they had some special gift; they
were praised for doing what it takes to succeed.

Both groups were exactly equal to begin with. But
right after the praise, they began to differ. As we
feared, the ability praise pushed students right into
the fixed mindset, and they showed all the signs of
it, too: When we gave them a choice, they rejected
a challenging new task that they could learn from.
They didn’t want to do anything that could expose
their flaws and call into question their talent.

When Guettel was thirteen, he was all set to star
in a Metropolitan Opera broadcast and TV movie of
Amahl and the Night Visitors. He bowed out, saying
that his voice had broken. “I kind of faked that my

voice was changing....I didn’t want to handle the
pressure.”

In contrast, when students were praised for effort,
90 percent of them wanted the challenging new task
that they could learn from.

Then we gave students some hard new problems,
which they didn’t do so well on. The ability kids now
thought they were not smart after all. If success had
meant they were intelligent, then less-than-success
meant they were deficient.

Guettel echoes this. “In my family, to be good is to
fail. To be very good is to fail....The only thing not a
failure is to be great.”

The effort kids simply thought the difficulty meant
“apply more effort or try new strategies.” They
didn’t see it as a failure, and they didn’t think it re-
flected on their intellect.

What about the students’ enjoyment of the prob-
lems? After the success, everyone loved the prob-
lems, but after the difficult problems, the ability stu-
dents said it wasn’t fun anymore. It can’t be fun
when your claim to fame, your special talent, is in
jeopardy.

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

Here's Adam Guettel: “I wish I could just have fun
and relax and not have the responsibility of that po-
tential to be some kind of great man.” As with the
kids in our study, the burden of talent was killing his
enjoyment.

The effort-praised students still loved the prob-
lems, and many of them said that the hard problems
were the most fun.

We then looked at the students’ performance.
After the experience with difficulty, the perform-
ance of the ability-praised students plummeted,
even when we gave them some more of the eas-
ier problems. Losing faith in their ability, they were
doing worse than when they started. The effort kids
showed better and better performance. They had
used the hard problems to sharpen their skills, so
that when they returned to the easier ones, they
were way ahead.

Since this was a kind of IQ test, you might say that
praising ability lowered the students’ IQs. And that
praising their effort raised them.

Guettel was not thriving. He was riddled with
obsessive-compulsive tics and bitten, bleeding fin-
gers. “Spend a minute with him—it takes only one—

and a picture of the terror behind the tics starts to
emerge,” says an interviewer. Guettel has also fought
serious, recurrent drug problems. Rather than em-
powering him, the “gift” has filled him with fear and
doubt. Rather than fulfilling his talent, this brilliant
composer has spent most of his life running from it.

One thing is hopeful—his recognition that he has
his own life course to follow that is not dictated by
other people and their view of his talent. One night
he had a dream about his grandfather. “I was walk-
ing him to an elevator. I asked him if I was any good.
He said, rather kindly, ‘You have your own voice.”

Is that voice finally emerging? For the score of The
Light in the Piazza, an intensely romantic musical,
Guettel won the 2005 Tony Award. Will he take it as
praise for talent or praise for effort? I hope it’s the
latter.

There was one more finding in our study that was
striking and depressing at the same time. We said to
each student: “You know, we're going to go to other
schools, and Ibet the kids in those schools would like
to know about the problems.” So we gave students a
page to write out their thoughts, but we also left a

Areste21 min danse chapitre 25%

Page 147
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

space for them to write the scores they had received
on the problems.

Would you believe that almost 40 percent of the
ability-praised students lied about their scores? And
always in one direction. In the fixed mindset, imper-
fections are shameful—especially if you're talented
—so they lied them away.

What's so alarming is that we took ordinary chil-
dren and made them into liars, simply by telling
them they were smart.

Right after I wrote these paragraphs, I met with
a young man who tutors students for their College
Board exams. He had come to consult with me about
one of his students. This student takes practice tests
and then lies to him about her score. He is supposed
to tutor her on what she doesn't know, but she can’t
tell him the truth about what she doesn’t know! And
she is paying money for this.

So telling children they're smart, in the end, made
them feel dumber and act dumber, but claim they
were smarter. I don’t think this is what we're aiming
for when we put positive labels—“gifted,” “talented,”
“prilliant”—on people. We don’t mean to rob them of

their zest for challenge and their recipes for success.
But that’s the danger.

Here is a letter from a man who'd read some of my
work:

Dear Dr. Dweck,

It was painful to read your chapter...as I

recognized myself therein.
Asa child I was a member of The Gifted

> Child Society and continually praised for

«) my intelligence. Now, after a lifetime of not

living up to my potential (I'm 49), I'm learn-
ing to apply myself to a task. And also to see
failure not asa sign of stupidity but as lack
of experience and skill. Your chapter helped
see myself in a new light.

This is the danger of positive labels. There are al-
ternatives, and I will return to them later in the
chapter on parents, teachers, and coaches.

NEGATIVE LABELS AND HOW THEY WORK

I was once a math whiz. In high school, I got a 99 in
algebra, a 99 in geometry, and a 99 in trigonometry,
and I was on the math team. I scored up there with
the boys on the air force test of visual-spatial ability,
which is why I got recruiting brochures from the air
force for many years to come.

Then I got a Mr. Hellman, a teacher who didn’t be-
lieve girls could do math. My grades declined, and I
never took math again.

I actually agreed with Mr. Hellman, but I didn’t
think it applied to me. Other girls couldn’t do math.
Mr. Hellman thought it applied to me, too, and I suc-
cumbed.

Everyone knows negative labels are bad, so you'd
think this would be a short section. But it isn’t
a short section, because psychologists are learning
how negative labels harm achievement.

No one knows about negative ability labels like
members of stereotyped groups. For example, Af-
rican Americans know about being stereotyped as

==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

lower in intelligence. And women know about being
stereotyped as bad at math and science. But I’m not
sure even they know how creepy these stereotypes
are.

Research by Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson
shows that even checking a box to indicate your race
or sex can trigger the stereotype in your mind and
lower your test score. Almost anything that reminds
you that you're black or female before taking a test
in the subject you're supposed to be bad at will
lower your test score—a lot. In many of their stud-
ies, blacks are equal to whites in their performance,
and females are equal to males, when no stereotype
is evoked. But just put more males in the room with
a female before a math test, and down goes the fe-
male's score.

This is why. When stereotypes are evoked, they fill
people's minds with distracting thoughts—with se-
cret worries about confirming the stereotype. People
usually aren’t even aware of it, but they don’t have
enough mental power left to do their best on the
test.

This doesn’t happen to everybody, however. It
mainly happens to people who are in a fixed mind-

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

set. It’s when people are thinking in terms of fixed
traits that the stereotypes get to them. Negative
stereotypes say: “You and your group are perman-
ently inferior.” Only people in the fixed mindset res-
onate to this message.

So in the fixed mindset, both positive and negative
labels can mess with your mind. When you're given
a positive label, you're afraid of losing it, and when
you're hit with a negative label, you're afraid of
deserving it.

When people are in a growth mindset, the stereo-
type doesn’t disrupt their performance. The growth
mindset takes the teeth out of the stereotype and
makes people better able to fight back. They don’t
believe in permanent inferiority. And if they are be-
hind—well, then they'll work harder, seek help, and
try to catch up.

The growth mindset also makes people able to take
what they can and what they need even from a
threatening environment. We asked African Ameri-
can students to write an essay for a competition.
They were told that when they finished, their essays
would be evaluated by Edward Caldwell II, a distin-

guished professor with an Ivy League pedigree. That
is, a representative of the white establishment.

Edward Caldwell III's feedback was quite critical,
but also helpful—and students’ reactions varied
greatly. Those with a fixed mindset viewed it as a
threat, an insult, or an attack. They rejected Caldwell
and his feedback.

Here’s what one student with the fixed mindset
thought: “He’s mean, he doesn't grade right, or he’s
obviously biased. He doesn’t like me.”

Said another: “He is a pompous asshole....Jt ap-
pears that he was searching for anything to discredit
the work.”

And another, deflecting the feedback with blame:
“He doesn't understand the conciseness of my
points. He thought it was vague because he was im-
patient when he read it. He dislikes creativity.”

None of them will learn anything from Edward
Caldwell’s feedback.

The students with the growth mindset may also
have viewed him as a dinosaur, but he was a dino-
saur who could teach them something.

“Before the evaluation, he came across as arrogant
and overdemanding. [After the evaluation?] ‘Fair’
seems to be the first word that comes to mind....It
seems like a new challenge.”

“He sounded like an arrogant, intimidating, and
condescending man. [What are your feelings about
the evaluation?] The evaluation was seemingly hon-
est and specific. In this sense, the evaluation could
bea stimulus...to produce better work.”

“He seems to be proud to the point of arrogance.
[The evaluation?] He was intensely critical....His
comments were helpful and clear, however. I feel I
will learn much from him.”

The growth mindset allowed African American
students to recruit Edward Caldwell III for their own
goals. They were in college to get an education and,
pompous asshole or not, they were going to get it.

Do! Belong Here?

Aside from hijacking people's abilities, stereotypes
also do damage by making people feel they don’t
belong. Many minorities drop out of college and

many women drop out of math and science because
they just don’t feel they fit in.

To find out how this happens, we followed college
women through their calculus course. This is often
when students decide whether math, or careers in-
volving math, are right for them. Over the semester,
we asked the women to report their feelings about
math and their sense of belonging in math. For ex-
ample, when they thought about math, did they feel
like a full-fledged member of the math community
or did they feel like an outsider; did they feel com-
fortable or did they feel anxious; did they feel good
or bad about their math skills?

The women with the growth mindset—those who
thought math ability could be improved—felt a
fairly strong and stable sense of belonging. And
they were able to maintain this even when they
thought there was a lot of negative stereotyping
going around. One student described it this way:
“In a math class, [female] students were told they
were wrong when they were not (they were in fact
doing things in novel ways). It was absurd, and re-
flected poorly on the instructor not to ‘see’ the stu-
dents’ good reasoning. It was alright because we

were working in groups and we were able to give &
receive support among us students....We discussed
our interesting ideas among ourselves.”

The stereotyping was disturbing to them (as it
should be), but they could still feel comfortable with
themselves and confident about themselves in a
math setting. They could fight back.

But women with the fixed mindset, as the semes-
ter wore on, felt a shrinking sense of belonging. And
the more they felt the presence of stereotyping in
their class, the more their comfort with math with-
ered. One student said that her sense of belonging
fell because “I was disrespected by the professor
with his comment, ‘that was a good guess, when-
ever I made a correct answer in class.”

The stereotype of low ability was able to invade
them—to define them—and take away their com-
fort and confidence. I’m not saying it’s their fault by
any means. Prejudice is a deeply ingrained societal
problem, and I do not want to blame the victims of
it. 1am simply saying that a growth mindset helps
people to see prejudice for what it is—someone else’s
view of them—and to confront it with their confi-
dence and abilities intact.

Trusting People’s Opinions

Many females have a problem not only with stereo-
types, but with other people's opinions of them in
general. They trust them too much.

One day, I went into a drugstore in Hawaii to buy
dental floss and deodorant, and, after fetching my
items, I went to wait in line. There were two women
together in front of me waiting to pay. Since Iam an
incurable time stuffer, at some point I decided to get
my money ready for when my turn came. So I walked
up, put the items way on the side of the counter,
and started to gather up the bills that were strewn
throughout my purse. The two women went berserk.
1 explained that in no way was I trying to cut in
front of them. I was just preparing for when my turn
came. I thought the matter was resolved, but when I
left the store, they were waiting for me. They got in
my face and yelled, “You’re a bad-mannered person!”

My husband, who had seen the whole thing from
beginning to end, thought they were nuts. But they
had a strange and disturbing effect on me, andI had
ahard time shaking off their verdict.

This vulnerability afflicts many of the most able,
high-achieving females. Why should this be? When
they’re little, these girls are often so perfect, and
they delight in everyone's telling them so. They're so
well behaved, they're so cute, they’re so helpful, and
they’re so precocious. Girls learn to trust people's es-
timates of them. “Gee, everyone's so nice to me; if
they criticize me, it must be true.” Even females at
the top universities in the country say that other
people's opinions are a good way to know their abil-
ities.

Boys are constantly being scolded and punished.
When we observed in grade school classrooms, we
saw that boys got eight times more criticism than
girls for their conduct. Boys are also constantly call-
ing each other slobs and morons. The evaluations
lose a lot of their power.

A male friend once called me a slob. He was over
to dinner at my house and, while we were eating,
I dripped some food on my blouse. “That’s because
you're such a slob,” he said. I was shocked. It was
then that I realized no one had ever said anything
like that to me. Males say it to each other all the time.
It may not be a kind thing to say, even in jest, but it

certainly makes them think twice before buying into
other people's evaluations.

Even when women reach the pinnacle of suc-
cess, other people's attitudes can get them. Frances
Conley is one of the most eminent neurosurgeons
in the world. In fact, she was the first woman
ever given tenure in neurosurgery at an American
medical school. Yet careless comments from male
colleagues—even assistants—could fill her with self-
doubt. One day during surgery, a man condescend-
ingly called her “honey.” Instead of returning the
compliment, she questioned herself. “Is a honey,”
she wondered, “especially this honey, good enough
and talented enough to be doing this operation?”

The fixed mindset, plus stereotyping, plus
women’s trust in other people's assessments of
them: All of these contribute to the gender gap in
math and science.

That gap is painfully evident in the world of high
tech. Julie Lynch, a budding techie, was already
writing computer code when she was in junior high
school. Her father and two brothers worked in tech-
nology, and she loved it, too. Then her computer
programming teacher criticized her. She had written

a computer program and the program ran just fine,
but he didn’t like a shortcut she had taken. Her inter-
est evaporated. Instead, she went on to study recre-
ation and public relations.

Math and science need to be made more hospitable
places for women. And women need all the growth
mindset they can get to take their rightful places in
these fields.

When Things Go Right

But let's look at the times the process goes right.

The Polgar family has produced three of the most
successful female chess players ever. How? Says
Susan, one of the three, “My father believes that in-
nate talent is nothing, that [success] is 99 percent
hard work. I agree with him.” The youngest daugh-
ter, Judit, is now considered the best woman chess
player of all time. She was not the one with the most
talent. Susan reports, “Judit was a slow starter, but
very hardworking.”

test, won a nationwide math contest, and is now a
neuroscience major at a top university. What's their
secret? Is it passed down in the genes? I believe it’s
passed down in the mindset. It’s the most growth-
mindset family I’ve ever seen.

In fact, their father applied the growth mindset to
everything. I'll never forget a conversation we had
some years ago. I was single at the time, and he
asked me what my plan was for finding a partner.
He was aghast when I said I didn’t have a plan. “You
wouldn't expect your work to get done by itself,” he
said. “Why is this any different?” It was inconceiv-
able to him that you could have a goal and not take
steps to make it happen.

In short, the growth mindset lets people—even
those who are targets of negative labels—use and
develop their minds fully. Their heads are not filled
with limiting thoughts, a fragile sense of belonging,
and a belief that other people can define them.

SPORTS: THE MINDSET OF A CHAMPION

In sports, everybody believes in talent. Even—or
especially—the experts. In fact, sports is where the
idea of “a natural” comes from—someone who looks
like an athlete, moves like an athlete, and is an ath-
lete, all without trying. So great is the belief in nat-
ural talent that many scouts and coaches search only
for naturals, and teams will vie with each other to
pay exorbitant amounts to recruit them.

Billy Beane was a natural. Everyone agreed he was
the next Babe Ruth.

But Billy Beane lacked one thing. The mindset of a
champion.

‘As Michael Lewis tells us in Moneyball, by the time
Beane was a sophomore in high school, he was the
highest scorer on the basketball team, the quarter-

back of the football team, and the best hitter on the
baseball team, batting .500 in one of the toughest
leagues in the country. His talent was real enough.

But the minute things went wrong, Beane searched
for something to break. “It wasn’t merely that he
didn’t like to fail; it was as if he didn’t know how to
fail.”

As he moved up in baseball from the minor leagues
to the majors, things got worse and worse. Each at-
bat became a nightmare, another opportunity for
humiliation, and with every botched at-bat, he went
to pieces. As one scout said, “Billy was of the opinion
that he should never make an out.” Sound familiar?

Did Beane try to fix his problems in constructive
ways? No, of course not, because this is a story of the
fixed mindset. Natural talent should not need effort.
Effort is for the others, the less endowed. Natural
talent does not ask for help. It is an admission of
weakness. In short, the natural does not analyze his
deficiencies and coach or practice them away. The
very idea of deficiencies is terrifying.

Being so imbued with the fixed mindset, Beane
was trapped. Trapped by his huge talent. Beane the
player never recovered from the fixed mindset, but

Beane the incredibly successful major-league execu-
tive did. How did this happen?

There was another player who lived and played
side by side with Beane in the minors and in the ma-
jors, Lenny Dykstra. Dykstra did not have a fraction
of Beane's physical endowment or “natural ability,”
but Beane watched him in awe. As Beane later de-
scribed, “He had no concept of failure....And I was
the opposite.”

Beane continues, “I started to get a sense of what
a baseball player was and I could see it wasn’t me. It
was Lenny.”

As he watched, listened, and mulled it over, it
dawned on Beane that mindset was more import-
ant than talent. And not long after that, as part
of a group that pioneered a radically new approach
to scouting and managing, he came to believe that
scoring runs—the whole point of baseball—was
much more about process than about talent.

Armed with these insights, Beane, as general man-
ager of the 2002 Oakland Athletics, led his team
to a season of 103 victories—winning the division
championship and almost breaking the American
League record for consecutive wins. The team had

the second-lowest payroll in baseball! They didn’t
buy talent, they bought mindset.

THE IDEA OF THE NATURAL
Now You See It, Now You Don’t

Physical endowment is not like intellectual endow-
ment, It's visible. Size, build, agility are all visible.
Practice and training are also visible, and they pro-
duce visible results. You would think that this would
dispel the myth of the natural. You could see Muggsy
Bogues at five foot three playing NBA basketball, and
Doug Flutie, the small quarterback who played for
the New England Patriots and the San Diego Char-
gers. You could see Pete Gray, the one-armed baseball
player who made it to the major leagues. Ben Hogan,
one of the greatest golfers of all time, who was
completely lacking in grace. Glenn Cunningham, the
great runner, who had badly burned and damaged
legs. Larry Bird and his lack of swiftness. You can
see the small or graceless or even “disabled” ones

who make it, and the god-like specimens who don't.
Shouldn't this tell people something?

Boxing experts relied on physical measurements,
called “tales of the tape,” to identify naturals. They
included measurements of the fighter’s fist, reach,
chest expansion, and weight. Muhammad Ali failed
these measurements. He was not a natural. He had
great speed but he didn’t have the physique of a great
fighter, he didn’t have the strength, and he didn’t
have the classical moves. In fact, he boxed all wrong.
He didn’t block punches with his arms and elbows.
He punched in rallies like an amateur. He kept his
jaw exposed. He pulled back his torso to evade the
impact of oncoming punches, which Jose Torres said
was “like someone in the middle of a train track try-
ing to avoid being hit by an oncoming train, not by
moving to one or the other side of the track, but by
running backwards.”

Sonny Liston, Ali’s adversary, was a natural. He had
it all—the size, the strength, and the experience. His
power was legendary. It was unimaginable that Ali
could beat Sonny Liston. The matchup was so ludi-
crous that the arena was only half full for the fight.

But aside from his quickness, Ali’s brilliance was
his mind. His brains, not his brawn. He sized up his
opponent and went for his mental jugular. Not only
did he study Liston’s fighting style, but he closely
observed what kind of person Liston was out of
the ring: “I read everything I could where he had
been interviewed. I talked with people who had been
around him or had talked with him. I would lay
in bed and put all of the things together and think
about them, and try to get a picture of how his mind
worked.” And then he turned it against him.

Why did Ali appear to “go crazy” before each fight?
Because, Torres says, he knew that a knockout punch
is the one they don’t see coming. Ali said, “Liston
had to believe that I was crazy. That I was capable of
doing anything. He couldn't see nothing to me at all
but mouth and that’s all I wanted him to see!”

Ali’s victory over Liston is boxing history. A fam-
ous boxing manager reflects on Ali:

“He was a paradox. His physical per-
formances in the ring were absolutely
wrong....Yet, his brain was always in perfect
working condition.” “He showed us all,” he
continued with a broad smile written across
his face, “that all victories come from here,”
hitting his forehead with his index finger.
Then he raised a pair of fists, saying: “Not
from here.”

This didn’t change people's minds about physical
endowment. No, we just look back at Ali now, with
our hindsight, and see the body of a great boxer.
It was gravy that his mind was so sharp and that
he made up amusing poems, but we still think his
greatness resided in his physique. And we don't
understand how the experts failed to see that great-
ness right from the start.

Michael Jordan

Michael Jordan wasn't a natural, either. He was the
hardest-working athlete, perhaps in the history of
sport.

It is well known that Michael Jordan was cut from
the high school varsity team—we laugh at the coach
who cut him. He wasn't recruited by the college
he wanted to play for (North Carolina State). Well,
weren't they foolish? He wasn’t drafted by the first
two NBA teams that could have chosen him. What a
blooper! Because now we know he was the greatest
basketball player ever, and we think it should have
been obvious from the start. When we look at him
we see MICHAEL JORDAN. But at that point he was
only Michael Jordan.

When Jordan was cut from the varsity team, he
was devastated. His mother says, “I told him to go
back and discipline himself.” Boy, did he listen. He
used to leave the house at six in the morning to go
practice before school. At the University of North
Carolina, he constantly worked on his weaknesses—
his defensive game and his ball handling and shoot-

ing. The coach was taken aback by his willingness to
work harder than anyone else. Once, after the team
lost the last game of the season, Jordan went and
practiced his shots for hours. He was preparing for
the next year. Even at the height of his success and
fame—after he had made himself into an athletic
genius—his dogged practice remained legendary.
Former Bulls assistant coach John Bach called him “a
genius who constantly wants to upgrade his genius.”

For Jordan, success stems from the mind. “The
mental toughness and the heart are a lot stronger
than some of the physical advantages you might
have. I’ve always said that and I’ve always believed
that.” But other people don’t. They look at Michael
Jordan and they see the physical perfection that led
inevitably to his greatness.

The Babe

What about Babe Ruth? Now, he was clearly no ves-
sel of human physical perfection. Here was the guy
with the famous appetites and a giant stomach bul-
ging out of his Yankee uniform. Wow, doesn’t that
make him even more of a natural? Didn’t he just ca-

rouse all night and then kind of saunter to the plate
the next day and punch out home runs?

The Babe was not a natural, either. At the begin-
ning of his professional career, Babe Ruth was not
that good a hitter. He had a lot of power, power
that came from his total commitment each time he
swung the bat. When he connected, it was breath-
taking, but he was highly inconsistent.

It’s true that he could consume astounding
amounts of liquor and unheard-of amounts of food.
After a huge meal, he could eat one or more whole
pies for dessert. But he could also discipline himself
when he had to. Many winters, he worked out the
entire off-season at the gym to become more fit. In
fact, after the 1925 season, when it looked as though
he was washed up, he really committed himself to
getting in shape, and it worked. From 1926 through
1931, he batted .354, averaging 50 home runs a year
and 155 runs batted in. Robert Creamer, his biog-
rapher, says, “Ruth put on the finest display of sus-
tained hitting that baseball has ever seen....From the
ashes of 1925, Babe Ruth rose like a rocket.” Through
discipline.

He also loved to practice. In fact, when he joined
the Boston Red Sox, the veterans resented him for
wanting to take batting practice every day. He wasn’t
just a rookie; he was a rookie pitcher. Who did he
think he was, trying to take batting practice? One
time, later in his career, he was disciplined and was
banned from a game. That was one thing. But they
wouldn't let him practice, either, and that really
hurt.

Ty Cobb argued that being a pitcher helped Ruth
develop his hitting. Why would being a pitcher help
his batting? “He could experiment at the plate,” Cobb
said. “No one cares much if a pitcher strikes out or
looks bad at bat, so Ruth could take that big swing.
If he missed, it didn’t matter....As time went on, he
learned more and more about how to control that big
swing and put the wood on the ball. By the time he
became a fulltime outfielder, he was ready.”

‘Yet we cling fast to what Stephen Jay Gould calls
“the common view that ballplayers are hunks of
meat, naturally and effortlessly displaying the tal-
ents that nature provided.”

The Fastest Women on Earth

What about Wilma Rudolph, hailed as the fastest
woman on earth after she won three gold medals for
sprints and relay in the 1960 Rome Olympics? She
was far from a physical wonder as a youngster. She
was a premature baby, the twentieth of twenty-two
children born to her parents, and a constantly sick
child. At four years of age, she nearly died of a long
struggle with double pneumonia, scarlet fever, and
polio(!), emerging with a mostly paralyzed left leg.
Doctors gave her little hope of ever using it again. For
eight years, she vigorously pursued physical therapy,
until at age twelve she shed her leg brace and began
to walk normally.

If this wasn’t a lesson that physical skills could be
developed, what was? She immediately went and ap-
plied that lesson to basketball and track, although
she lost every race she entered in her first official
track meet. After her incredible career, she said, “I
just want to be remembered as a hardworking lady.”

What about Jackie Joyner-Kersee, hailed as the
greatest female athlete of all time? Between 1985

and the beginning of 1996, she won every heptath-
lon she competed in. What exactly is a heptathlon?
It’s a grueling two-day, seven-part event consisting
of a 100-meter hurdles race, the high jump, the jav-
elin throw, a 200-meter sprint, the long jump, the
shotput, and an 800-meter run. No wonder the win-
ner gets to be called the best female athlete in the
world. Along the way, Joyner-Kersee earned the six
highest scores in the history of the sport, set world
records, and won two world championships as well
as two Olympic gold medals (six if we count the ones
in other events).

Was she a natural? Talent she had, but when she
started track, she finished in last place for quite
some time. The longer she worked, the faster she
got, but she still didn’t win any races. Finally, she
began to win. What changed? “Some might attrib-
ute my transformation to the laws of heredity....But
I think it was my reward for all those hours of work
on the bridle path, the neighborhood sidewalks and
the schoolhouse corridors.”

Sharing the secret of her continued success, she
says, “There is something about seeing myself im-
prove that motivates and excites me. It’s that way

now, after six Olympic medals and five world rec-
ords. And it was the way I was in junior high, just
starting to enter track meets.”

Her last two medals (a world-championship and an
Olympic medal) came during an asthma attack and
a severe, painful hamstring injury. It was not natural
talent taking its course. It was mindset having its
say.

Naturals Shouldn't Need Effort

Did you know there was once a strong belief that
you couldn’t physically train for golf, and that if you
built your strength you would lose your “touch”?
Until Tiger Woods came along with his workout
regimes and fierce practice habits and won every
tournament there was to win.

In some cultures, people who tried to go beyond
their natural talent through training received sharp
disapproval. You were supposed to accept your sta-
tion in life. These cultures would have hated Maury
Wills. Wills was an eager baseball player in the
1950s and ’60s with a dream to be a major lea-
guer. His problem was that his hitting wasn’t good

enough, so when the Dodgers signed him, they sent
him down to the minor leagues. He proudly an-
nounced to his friends, “In two years, I'm going to be
in Brooklyn playing with Jackie Robinson.”

He was wrong. Despite his optimistic prediction
and grueling daily practice, he languished in the mi-
nors for eight and a half years. At the seven-and-a-
half-year mark, the team manager made a batting
suggestion, telling Wills, “You're in a seven-and-a-
half-year slump, you have nothing to lose.” Shortly
thereafter, when the Dodger shortstop broke his toe,
Wills was called up. He had his chance.

His batting was still not good enough. Not ready
to give up, he went to the first-base coach for help;
they worked together several hours a day aside from
Wills’s regular practice. Still not good enough. Even
the gritty Wills was now ready to quit, but the first-
base coach refused to let him. Now that the mechan-
ics were in place, Wills needed work on his mind.

He began to hit—and, with his great speed, he
began to steal bases. He studied the throws of the
opposing pitchers and catchers, figuring out the
best moment to steal a base. He developed sudden,
powerful takeoffs and effective slides. His stealing

began to distract the pitchers, throw off the catchers,
and thrill the fans. Wills went on to break Ty Cobb's
record for stolen bases, a record unchallenged for
forty-seven years. That season, he was voted the
most valuable player in the National League.

Sports 1Q

You would think the sports world would have to see
the relation between practice and improvement—
and between the mind and performance—and stop
harping so much on innate physical talent. Yet it’s
almost as if they refuse to see. Perhaps it’s because,
as Malcolm Gladwell suggests, people prize natural
endowment over earned ability. As much as our cul-
ture talks about individual effort and self-improve-
ment, deep down, he argues, we revere the naturals.
Welike to think of our champions and idols as super-
heroes who were born different from us. We don’t
like to think of them as relatively ordinary people
who made themselves extraordinary. Why not? To
me that is so much more amazing.

Even when experts are willing to recognize the role
of the mind, they continue to insist that it’s all in-
nate!

This really hit me when I came upon an article
about Marshall Faulk, the great running back for the
St. Louis Rams football team. Faulk had just become
the first player to gain a combined two thousand
rushing and receiving yards in four consecutive sea-
sons.

The article, written on the eve of the 2002 Super
Bowl, talked about Faulk’s uncanny skill at knowing
where every player on the field is, even in the swirl-
ing chaos of twenty-two running and falling players.
He not only knows where they are, but he also knows
what they are doing, and what they are about to do.
According to his teammates, he’s never wrong.

Incredible. How does he do it? As Faulk tells it,
he spent years and years watching football. In high
school he even got a job as a ballpark vendor, which
he hated, in order to watch pro football. As he
watched, he was always asking the question Why?:
“why are we running this play?” “Why are we at-
tacking it this way?” “Why are they doing that?”
“why are they doing this?” “That question,” Faulk

says, “basically got me involved in football in a more
in-depth way.” As a pro, he never stopped asking
why and probing deeper into the workings of the
game.

Clearly, Faulk himself sees his skills as the product
of his insatiable curiosity and study.

How do players and coaches see it? As a gift.
“Marshall has the highest football IQ of any position
player I’ve ever played with,” says a veteran team-
mate. Other teammates describe his ability to rec-
ognize defensive alignments flawlessly asa “savant’s
gift” In awe of his array of skills, one coach ex-
plained: “It takes a very innate football intelligence
to do all that.”

“CHARACTER”

But aren’t there some naturals, athletes who really
seem to have “it” from the start? Yes, and as it was
for Billy Beane and John McEnroe, sometimes it’s a
curse. With all the praise for their talent and with
how little they’ve needed to work or stretch them-
selves, they can easily fall into a fixed mindset.

Bruce Jenner (now Caitlyn Jenner), 1976 Olympic
gold medalist in the decathlon, says, “If I wasn’t dys-
lexic, I probably wouldn’t have won the Games. If I
had been a better reader, then that would have come
easily, sports would have come easily...and I never
would have realized that the way you get ahead in
life is hard work.”

The naturals, carried away with their superiority,
don’t learn how to work hard or how to cope with
setbacks. This is the story of Pedro Martinez, the bril-
liant pitcher then with the Boston Red Sox, who self-
destructed when they needed him most. But it’s an
even larger story too, a story about character.

A group of sportswriters from The New York Times
and The Boston Globe were on the Delta shuttle to
Boston. So was I. They were headed to Game 3 of
the 2003 American League play-off series between
the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. They
were talking about character, and they all agreed
—the Boston writers reluctantly—that the Yankees
had it.

Among other things, they remembered what the
Yankees had done for New York two years before. It
was October 2001, and New Yorkers had just lived

through September 11. I was there and we were dev-
astated. We needed some hope. The city needed the
Yankees to go for it—to go for the World Series. But
the Yankees had lived through it, too, and they were
injured and exhausted. They seemed to have noth-
ing left. I don’t know where they got it from, but
they dug down deep and they polished off one team
after another, each win bringing us a little bit back
to life, each one giving us a little more hope for the
future. Fueled by our need, they became the Ameri-
can League East champs, then the American League
champs, and then they were in the World Series,
where they made a valiant run and almost pulled
it off. Everyone hates the Yankees. It’s the team the
whole country roots against. I grew up hating the
Yankees, too, but after that I had to love them. This is
what the sportswriters meant by character.

Character, the sportswriters said. They know it
when they see it—it’s the ability to dig down and
find the strength even when things are going against
you.

The very next day, Pedro Martinez, the dazzling but
over-pampered Boston pitcher, showed what char-
acter meant. By showing what it isn’t.

No one could have wanted this American League
Championship more than the Boston Red Sox. They
hadn’t won a World Series in eighty-five years, ever
since the curse of the Bambino—that is, ever since
Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Babe Ruth to the Yan-
kees for money to finance a Broadway show. It was
bad enough that he was selling the best left-handed
pitcher in baseball (which Ruth was at the time), but
he was selling him to the despised enemy.

The Yankees went on to dominate baseball, win-
ning, it seemed, endless World Series. Meanwhile
Boston made it to four World Series and several play-
offs, but they always lost. And they always lost in the
most tragic way possible. By coming achingly near
to victory and then having a meltdown. Here, finally,
was another chance to fight off the curse and defeat
their archrivals. If they won, they would make that
trip to the World Series and the Yankees would stay
home. Pedro Martinez was their hope. In fact, earlier
in the season, he had cursed the curse.

Yet after pitching a beautiful game, Martinez was
losing his lead and falling behind. What did he do
then? He hit a batter with the ball (Karim Gar-
cia), threatened to bean another (Jorge Posada), and

hurled a seventy-two-year-old man to the ground
(Yankee coach Don Zimmer).

As New York Times writer Jack Curry wrote: “We
knew we were going to have Pedro vs. Roger
[Clemens] on a memorable afternoon at Fenway
Park....But no one expected to watch Pedro against
Garcia, Pedro against Posada, Pedro against Zim-

mer.”

Even the Boston writers were aghast. Dan Shaugh-
nessy, of the Globe, asked: “Which one would you
rather have now, Red Sox fans? Roger Clemens, who
kept his composure and behaved like a professional
Saturday night, winning the game for his team des-
pite his obvious anger? Or Martinez, the baby who
hits a guy after he blows the lead, then points at his
head and at Yankees catcher Jorge Posada, threaten-
ing, ‘You're next’?...Red Sox fans don't like to hear
this, but Martinez was an embarrassment Saturday,
and a disgrace to baseball. He gets away with it be-
cause he’s Pedro. And the Sox front office enables
him. Could Martinez one time stand up and admit

down and turn an important setback into an im-
portant win. Nor, like Billy Beane, could he admit his
faults and learn from them. Because he threw his
tantrum instead of doing the job, the Yankees won
the game and went on to win the play-off by one
game.

The sportswriters on the plane agreed that charac-
ter is all. But they confessed that they didn’t under-
stand where it comes from. Yet I think by now we're
getting the idea that character grows out of mindset.

We now know that there is a mindset in which
people are enmeshed in the idea of their own talent
and specialness. When things go wrong, they lose
their focus and their ability, putting everything they
want—and in this case, everything the team and the
fans so desperately want—in jeopardy.

We also know that there is a mindset that helps
people cope well with setbacks, points them to good
strategies, and leads them to act in their best inter-
est.

Wait. The story’s not over. One year later, the Sox
and the Yankees went head-to-head again. Whoever
won four games out of the seven would be the
American League Champions and would take that

trip to the World Series. The Yankees won the first
three games, and Boston's humiliating fate seemed
sealed once again.

But that year Boston had put their prima donnas
on notice. They traded one, tried to trade another
(no one wanted him), and sent out the message: This
is a team, not a bunch of stars. We work hard for each
other.

Four games later, the Boston Red Sox were the
American League Champions. And then the World
Champions. It was the first time since 1904 that
Boston had beaten the Yankees in a championship
series, showing two things. First, that the curse was
over. And second, that character can be learned.

More About Character

Let’s take it from the top with Pete Sampras and
the growth mindset. In 2000, Sampras was at Wim-
bledon, trying for his thirteenth Grand Slam tennis
victory. If he won, he would break Roy Emerson's
record of twelve wins in top tournaments. Although
Sampras managed to make it to the finals, he had not
played that well in the tournament and was not op-

timistic about his chances against the young, power-
ful Patrick Rafter.

Sampras lost the first set, and was about to lose the
second set. He was down 4-1 in the tiebreaker. Even
he said, “I really felt like it was slipping away.” What
would McEnroe have done? What would Pedro Mar-
tinez have done? What did Sampras do?

‘As William Rhoden puts it, “He...searched for a
frame of reference that could carry him through.”
Sampras says, “When you're sitting on the change-
cover you think of past matches that you've lost the
first set...came back and won the next three. There's
time. You reflect on your past experiences, being
able to get through it.”

Suddenly, Sampras had a five-point run. Then two
more. He had won the second set and he was alive.

“Last night,” Rhoden says, “Sampras displayed all
the qualities of the hero: the loss in the first set, vul-
nerability near defeat, then a comeback and a final
triumph.”

Jackie Joyner-Kersee talked herself through an
asthma attack during her last world championship.
She was in the 800-meter race, the last event of
the heptathlon, when she felt the attack coming on.

“Just keep pumping your arms,” she instructed her-
self. “It’s not that bad, so keep going. You can make
it. You're not going to have a full-blown attack. You
have enough air. You've got this thing won....Just
run as hard as you can in this last 200 meters,
Jackie.” She instructed herself all the way to victory.
“T have to say this is my greatest triumph, consider-
ing the competition and the ups and downs I was
going through....If I really wanted it, I had to pull it
together.”

In her last Olympics, the dreaded thing happened.
A serious hamstring injury forced her to drop out
of the heptathlon. She was devastated. She was no
longer a contender in her signature event, but would
she be a contender in the long jump a few days
later? Her first five jumps said no. They were no-
where near medal level. But the sixth jump won her
a bronze medal, more precious than her gold ones.
“The strength for that sixth jump came from my as-
sorted heartbreaks over the years...I’d collected all
my pains and turned them into one mighty perform-
ance.”

Character, Heart, Will, and the Mind of a Champion

It goes by different names, but it’s the same thing.
It’s what makes you practice, and it’s what allows
you to dig down and pull it out when you most need
it.

Remember how McEnroe told us all the things that
went wrong to make him lose each match he lost?
There was the time it was cold and the time it was
hot, the time he was jealous and the times he was
upset, and the many, many times he was distracted.
But, as Billie Jean King tells us, the mark of a cham-
pion is the ability to win when things are not quite
right—when you're not playing well and your emo-
tions are not the right ones. Here’s how she learned
what being a champion meant.

King was in the finals at Forest Hills play-
ing against Margaret Smith (later Margaret Smith
Court), who was at the peak of her greatness. King
had played her more than a dozen times and had

beaten her only once. In the first set, King played
fabulously. She didn’t miss a volley and built a nice
lead. Suddenly, the set was over. Smith had won it.

In the second set, King again built a commanding
lead and was serving to win the set. Before she knew
it, Smith had won the set and the match.

At first, King was perplexed. She had never built
such a commanding lead in such an important
match. But then she had a Eureka! moment. All at
once, she understood what a champion was: some-
one who could raise their level of play when they
needed to. When the match is on the line, they sud-
denly “get around three times tougher.”

Jackie Joyner-Kersee had her Eureka! moment too.
She was fifteen years old and competing in the hept-
athlon at the AAU Junior Olympics. Everything now
depended on the last event, the 800-meter race, an
event she dreaded. She was exhausted and she was
competing against an expert distance runner whose
times she had never matched. She did this time. “I
felt a kind of high. I’'d proven that I could win if I
wanted it badly enough... That win showed me that
I could not only compete with the best athletes in
the country, I could will myself to win.”

Often called the best woman soccer player in the
world, Mia Hamm says she was always asked, “Mia,
what is the most important thing for a soccer player
to have?” With no hesitation, she answered, “Mental
toughness.” And she didn’t mean some innate trait.
When eleven players want to knock you down, when
you're tired or injured, when the referees are against
you, you can’t let any of it affect your focus. How
do you do that? You have to learn how. “It is,” said
Hamm, “one of the most difficult aspects of soccer
and the one I struggle with every game and every
practice.”

By the way, did Hamm think she was the greatest
player in the world? No. “And because of that,” she
said, “someday I just might be.”

In sports, there are always do-or-die situations,
when a player must come through or it’s all over.
Jack Nicklaus, the famed golfer, was in these situ-
ations many times in his long professional career on
the PGA Tour—where the tournament rested on his
making a must-have shot. If you had to guess, how
many of these shots do you think he missed? The an-
‘wer is one. One!

That's the championship mentality. It’s how
people who are not as talented as their opponents
win games. John Wooden, the legendary basketball
coach, tells one of my favorite stories. Once, while
Wooden was still a high school coach, a player
was unhappy because he wasn’t included in the big
games. The player, Eddie Pawelski, begged Wooden
to give hima chance, and Wooden relented. “All right
Eddie,” he said, “I'll give you a chance. I'll start you
against Fort Wayne Central tomorrow night.”

“Suddenly,” Wooden tells us, “I wondered where
those words came from.” Three teams were locked
in a battle for number one in Indiana—one was his
team and another was Fort Wayne Central, tomor-
row night’s team.

The next night, Wooden started Eddie. He figured
that Eddie would last at most a minute or two, es-
pecially since he was up against Fort Wayne's Arm-
strong, the toughest player in the state.

“Eddie literally took him apart,” Wooden reports.
“Armstrong got the lowest point total of his career.
Eddie scored 12, and our team showed the best bal-
ance of all season....But in addition to his scoring,
his defense, rebounding, and play-making were ex-

cellent.” Eddie never sat out again and was named
most valuable player for the next two years.

All of these people had character. None of them
thought they were special people, born with the
right to win. They were people who worked hard,
who learned how to keep their focus under pressure,
and who stretched beyond their ordinary abilities
when they had to.

Staying on Top

Character is what allows you to reach the top and
stay there. Darryl Strawberry, Mike Tyson, and Mar-
tina Hingis reached the top, but they didn’t stay
there. Isn’t that because they had all kinds of per-
sonal problems and injuries? Yes, but so have many
other champions. Ben Hogan was hit by a bus and
was physically destroyed, but he made it back to the
top.

“believe ability can get you to the top,” says coach
John Wooden, “but it takes character to keep you
there....It’s so easy to...begin thinking you can just
‘turn it on’ automatically, without proper prepar-
ation, It takes real character to keep working as hard

or even harder once you're there. When you read
about an athlete or team that wins over and over and
over, remind yourself, ‘More than ability, they have

character.”

Let's take an even deeper look at what character
means, and how the growth mindset creates it. Stu-
art Biddle and his colleagues measured adolescents’
and young adults’ mindset about athletic ability.
Those with the fixed mindset were the people who
believed that:

“You have a certain level of ability in sports and
you cannot really do much to change that level.”

“To be good at sports you need to be naturally
gifted.”

In contrast, the people with the growth mindset
agreed that:

“How good you are at sports will always improve if
you work harder at it.”

“To be successful in sports, you need to learn tech-
niques and skills and practice them regularly.”

Those with the growth mindset were the ones who
showed the most character or heart. They were the
ones who had the minds of champions. What do I

mean? Let's look at the findings from these sports re-
searchers and see.

WHAT IS SUCCESS?

Finding #1: Those with the growth mindset found
success in doing their best, in learning and improv-
ing. And this is exactly what we find in the cham-
pions.

“For me the joy of athletics has never resided in
winning,” Jackie Joyner-Kersee tells us, “...I derive
just as much happiness from the process as from the
results. I don’t mind losing as long as I see improve-
ment or I feel I’ve done as well as I possibly could. If
lose, Ijust go back to the track and work some more.”

This idea—that personal success is when you work
your hardest to become your best—was central to
John Wooden's life. In fact, he says, “there were
many, many games that gave me as much pleasure
as any of the ten national championship games we
won, simply because we prepared fully and played
near our highest level of ability.”

Tiger Woods and Mia Hamm are two of the fiercest
competitors who ever lived. They love to win, but
what counted most for them is the effort they made
even when they didn’t win. They could be proud of
that. McEnroe and Beane could not.

After the 98 Masters tournament, Woods was dis-
appointed that he did not repeat his win of the
previous year, but he felt good about his top-ten fin-
ish: “I squeezed the towel dry this week. I'm very
proud of the way I hung in there.” Or after a British
Open, where he finished third: “Sometimes you get
even more satisfaction out of creating a score when
things aren’t completely perfect, when you're not
feeling so well about your swing.”

Tiger is a hugely ambitious man. He wants to be
the best, even the best ever. “But the best me—that’s
alittle more important.”

Mia Hamm tells.us, “After every game or practice, if
you walk off the field knowing that you gave every-
thing you had, you will always be a winner.” Why
did the country fall in love with her team? “They
saw that we truly love what we do and that we gave
everything we had to each other and to each game.”

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

For those with the fixed mindset, success is
about establishing their superiority, pure and sim-
ple. Being that somebody who is worthier than the
nobodies. “There was a time—I'll admit it,” McEnroe
says, “when my head was so big it could barely fit
through the door.” Where's the talk about effort and
personal best? There is none. “Some people don’t
want to rehearse; they just want to perform. Other
people want to practice a hundred times first. I'm in
the former group.” Remember, in the fixed mindset,
effort is not a cause for pride. It is something that
casts doubt on your talent.

WHAT IS FAILURE?

Finding #2: Those with the growth mindset found
setbacks motivating. They’re informative. They're a
wake-up call.

Only once did Michael Jordan try to coast. It was
the year he returned to the Bulls after his stint in
baseball, and he learned his lesson. The Bulls were
eliminated in the play-offs. “You can’t leave and
think you can come back and dominate this game. I
will be physically and mentally prepared from now

on.” Truer words are rarely spoken. The Bulls won
the NBA title the next three years.

Michael Jordan embraced his failures. In fact, in
one of his favorite ads for Nike, he says: “I've missed
more than nine thousand shots. I've lost almost
three hundred games. Twenty-six times, I’ve been
trusted to take the game-winning shot, and missed.”
You can be sure that each time, he went back and
practiced the shot a hundred times.

Here's how Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the great bas-
ketball player, reacted when college basketball out-
lawed his signature shot, the dunk (later reinstated).
Many thought that would stop his ascent to great-
ness. Instead, he worked twice as hard on developing
other shots: his bank shot off the glass, his skyhook,
and his turnaround jumper. He had absorbed the
growth mindset from Coach Wooden, and put it to
good use.

In the fixed mindset, setbacks label you.

John McEnroe could never stand the thought of
losing. Even worse was the thought of losing to
someone who was a friend or relative. That would
make him less special. For example, he hoped
desperately for his best friend, Peter, to lose in the

finals at Maui after Peter had beaten him in an earlier
round, He wanted it so badly he couldn’t watch the
match. Another time, he played his brother Patrick
in a finals in Chicago, and said to himself, “God, if
I lose to Patrick, that’s it. I'm jumping off the Sears
tower.”

Here’s how failure motivated him. In 1979, he
played mixed doubles at Wimbledon. He didn’t play
mixed doubles again for twenty years. Why? He and
his partner lost in three straight sets. Plus, McEnroe
lost his serve twice, while no one else lost theirs
even once. “That was the ultimate embarrassment. I
said, ‘That's it. I'm never playing again. Ican’t handle
this’

In 1981, McEnroe bought a beautiful black Les Paul
guitar. That week, he went to see Buddy Guy play
at the Checkerboard Lounge in Chicago. Instead of
feeling inspired to take lessons or practice, McEnroe
went home and smashed his guitar to pieces.

Here's how failure motivated Sergio Garcia, an-
other golden boy with mindset issues. Garcia had
taken the golf world by storm with his great shots
and his charming, boyish ways; he seemed like a
younger Tiger. But when his performance took a

dive, so did his charm. He fired caddie after caddie,
blaming them for everything that went wrong. He
once blamed his shoe when he slipped and missed
a shot. To punish the shoe, he threw it and kicked
it. Unfortunately, he almost hit an official. These are
the ingenious remedies for failure in the fixed mind-
set.

TAKING CHARGE OF SUCCESS.

Finding #3: People with the growth mindset in
sports (as in pre-med chemistry) took charge of the
processes that bring success—and that maintain it.

How come Michael Jordan’s skill didn’t seem to de-
cline with age? He did lose some stamina and agil-
ity with age, but to compensate, he worked even
harder on conditioning and on his moves, like the
turnaround jump shot and his celebrated fallaway
jumper. He came into the league as a slam-dunker
and he left as the most complete player ever to grace
the game.

Woods, too, took charge of the process. Golf is like
a wayward lover. When you think you've conquered

her, she will certainly desert you, Butch Harmon,
the renowned coach, says “the golf swing is just
about the farthest thing from a perfectible discip-
line in athletics....The most reliable swings are only
relatively repeatable. They never stop being works in
progress.” That’s why even the biggest golf star wins
only a fraction of the time, and may not win for long
periods of time (which happened to Woods even at
the height of his career). And that’s also why taking
charge of the process is so crucial.

With this in mind, Tiger’s dad made sure to teach
him how to manage his attention and his course
strategy. Mr. Woods would make loud noises or
throw things just as little Tiger was about to swing.
This helped him become less distractible. (Do we
know someone else who could have profited from
this training?) When Tiger was three years old, his
dad was already teaching him to think about course
management. After Tiger drove the ball behind a big
clump of trees, Mr. Woods asked the toddler what his
plan was.

Woods carried on what his dad started by taking
control of all parts of his game. He experimented
constantly with what worked and what didn’t, but

he also had a long-term plan that guided him: “I
know my game. I know what I want to achieve, I
know how to get there.”

Like Michael Jordan, Woods managed his motiv-
ation. He did this by making his practice into fun:
“Tove working on shots, carving them this way and
that, and proving to myself that I can hit a certain
shot on command.” And he did it by thinking of
a rival out there somewhere who would challenge
him: “He's twelve. I have to give myself a reason
to work so hard. He's out there somewhere. He's
twelve.”

Mark O'Meara, Woods's golf partner and friend,
had a choice. It’s not easy to play beside someone as
extraordinary as Woods. O’Meara’s choice was this:
He could feel jealous of and diminished by Woods's
superior play, or he could learn from it. He chose
the latter path. O'Meara was one of those talented
players who never seemed to fulfill his potential.
His choice—to take charge of his game—turned him
around.

At the age of twenty-one, Woods had won the
Masters Tournament. That night, he slept with his

arms around his prize, the famous green jacket. One
year later, he put a green jacket on Mark O’Meara.

From McEnroe, we hear little talk of taking control.
When he was on top, we hear little mention of work-
ing on his game to stay on top. When he was doing
poorly, we hear little self-reflection or analysis (ex-
cept to pin the blame). For example, when he didn’t
do as well as expected for part of ’82, we hear that
“little things happened that kept me off my game for
weeks at a time and prevented me from dominating
the tour.”

Always a victim of outside forces. Why didn’t he
take charge and learn how to perform well in spite
of them? That’s not the way of the fixed mindset.
In fact, rather than combating those forces or fixing
his problems, he tells us he wished he played a team
sport, so he could conceal his flaws: “If you're not at
your peak, you can hide it so much easier in a team
sport.”

McEnroe also admits that his on-court temper
tantrums were often a cover for choking and only
made things worse. So what did he do? Nothing. He
wished someone else would do it for him. “When
youcan’'t control yourself, you want someone to doit

for you—that’s where I acutely missed being part of
a team sport....People would have worked with me,
coached me.”

Or: “The system let me get away with more and
more...I really liked it less and less.” He got mad at
the system! Hi there, John. This was your life. Ever
think of taking responsibility?

No, because in the fixed mindset, you don’t take
control of your abilities and your motivation. You
look for your talent to carry you through, and when
it doesn’t, well then, what else could you have
done? You are not a work in progress, you're a fin-
ished product. And finished products have to protect
themselves, lament, and blame. Everything but take
charge.

WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A STAR?

Does a star have less responsibility to the team than
other players? Is it just their role to be great and win
games? Or does a star have more responsibility than
others? What does Michael Jordan think?

“In our society sometimes it’s hard to come to grips
with filling a role instead of trying to be a superstar,”
says Jordan. A superstar’s talent can win games, but
it’s teamwork that wins championships.

Coach John Wooden claims he was tactically and
strategically average. So how did he win ten national
championships? One of the main reasons, he tells us,
is because he was good at getting players to fill roles
as part of a team. “I believe, for example, I could have
made Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar] the greatest scorer in
college history. I could have done that by developing
the team around that ability of his. Would we have
won three national championships while he was at
UCLA? Never.”

In the fixed mindset, athletes want to validate
their talent. This means acting like a superstar, not
“just” a team member. But, as with Pedro Martinez,
this mindset works against the important victories
they want to achieve.

A telling tale is the story of Patrick Ewing, who
could have been a basketball champion. The year
Ewing was a draft pick—by far the most exciting
pick of the year—the Knicks won the lottery and to
their joy got to select Ewing for their team. They

now had “twin towers,” the seven-foot Ewing and
the seven-foot Bill Cartwright, their high-scoring
center. They had a chance to do it all.

They just needed Ewing to be the power forward.
He wasn’t happy with that. Center is the star posi-
tion. And maybe he wasn’t sure he could hit the
outside shots that a power forward has to hit. What
if he had really given his all to learn that position?
(Alex Rodriguez, then the best shortstop in baseball,
agreed to play third base when he joined the Yan-
kees. He had to retrain himself and, for a while, he
wasn’t all he had been.) Instead, Cartwright was sent
to the Bulls, and Ewing's Knicks never won a cham-
pionship.

Then there is the tale of the football player Key-
shawn Johnson, another immensely talented player
who was devoted to validating his own greatness.
When asked before a game how he compared to a
star player on the opposing team, he replied, “You're
trying to compare a flashlight to a star. Flashlights
only last so long. A star is in the sky forever.”

Was he a team player? “I ama team player, but I’m
an individual first....I have to be the No. 1 guy with
the football. Not No. 2 or No. 3. If I'm not the No. 1

guy, I’m no good to you. I can’t really help you.” What
does that mean? For his definition of team player,
Johnson was traded by the Jets, and, after that, de-
activated by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

I’ve noticed an interesting thing. When some star
players are interviewed after a game, they say we.
They are part of the team and they think of them-
selves that way. When others are interviewed, they
say I and they refer to their teammates as something
apart from themselves—as people who are privil-
eged to participate in their greatness.

Every Sport Is a Team Sport

You know, just about every sport is in some sense a
team sport. No one does it alone. Even in individual
sports, like tennis or golf, great athletes have a team
—coaches, trainers, caddies, managers, mentors.
This really hit me when I read about Diana Nyad, the
woman who holds the world’s record for open-water
swimming. What could be more of alone sport than
swimming? All right, maybe you need a little row-
boat to follow you and make sure you're okay.

When Nyad hatched her plan, the open-water
swimming record for both men and women was
sixty miles. She wanted to swim one hundred. After
months of arduous training, she was ready. But with
her went a team of guides (for measuring the winds
and the current, and watching for obstacles), divers
(looking for sharks), NASA experts (for guidance on
nutrition and endurance—she needed eleven hun-
dred calories per hour and she lost twenty-nine
pounds on the trip!), and trainers who talked her
through uncontrollable shivers, nausea, hallucin-
ations, and despair. Her new record was 102.5 miles.
It was her name in the record books, but it took fifty-
one other people to do it.

HEARING THE MINDSETS.

You can already hear the mindsets in young athletes.
Listen for them.

It’s 2004, Iciss Tillis is a college basketball star,

sportswriter Viv Bernstein. “It is a reminder of all
Tillis hopes she will never be.”

Quick Tillis was a contender in the 1980s. In ’81,
he boxed for the world heavyweight title; in ’85, he
was in the movie The Color Purple (as a boxer); and
in’86, he was the first boxer to go the distance (ten
rounds) with Mike Tyson. But he never made it tothe
top.

Iciss Tillis, who is a senior, says, “This is the year
to win a national championship. I just feel like I'd be
such a failure...[I'd] feel like I’m regressing back and
I’m going to end up like my dad: a nobody.”

Uh-oh, it’s the somebody-nobody syndrome. If I
win, I'll be somebody; if I lose I'll be nobody.

Tillis’s anger at her father may be justified—he
abandoned her as a child. But this thinking is get-
ting in her way. “Perhaps nobody else has that
combination of size, skill, quickness, and vision in
the womens college game,” says Bernstein. “Yet few
would rate Tillis ahead of the top two players in
the country: Connecticut's Diana Taurasi and [Duke's
Alana] Beard.” Tillis’s performance often fails to
match her ability.

She's frustrated that people have high expectations
for her and want her to play better. “I feel like I have
to come out and have a triple-double [double digits
in points scored, rebounds, and assists], dunk the
ball over-the-head 360 [leave your feet, turn com-
pletely around in the air, and slam the ball into the
basket] and maybe people will be like, ‘Oh, she not
that bad.’”

I don’t think people want the impossible. I think
they just want to see her use her wonderful talent
to the utmost. I think they want her to develop the
skills she needs to reach her goals.

Worrying about being a nobody is not the mind-
set that motivates and sustains champions. (Hard as
it is, perhaps Tillis should admire the fact that her
father went for it, instead of being contemptuous
that he didn’t quite make it.) Somebodies are not de-
termined by whether they won or lost. Somebodies
are people who go for it with all they have. If you
go for it with all you have, Iciss Tillis—not just in
the games, but in practice too—you will already be a
somebody.

Here’s the other mindset. It’s six-foot-three Can-
dace Parker, then a seventeen-year-old senior at

their great coach, Pat Summitt.

Candace has a very different father from Iciss, a
dad who is teaching her a different lesson: “If you

Several years before, when he was coach of her
team, her dad lost his cool with her during a tourna-
ment game. She was not going for the rebounds, she
was shooting lazy shots from the outside instead of
using her height near the basket, and she was not
exerting herself on defense. “Now let's go out and try
harder!” So what happened? She went out and scored
twenty points in the second half, and had ten re-
bounds. They blew the other team away. “He lit a fire
under me. And I knew he was right.”

Candace lights the same fire under herself now.
Rather than being content to be a star, she looks to
improve all the time. When she returned from knee
surgery, she knew what she needed to work on—
her timing, nerves, and wind. When her three-point
shot went bad, she asked her father to come to the
gym to work on it with her. “Whether it be in bas-

ketball or everyday life,” she says, “nothing is prom-
ised.”

Only weeks later, the mindset prophecies were
already coming true. Two things happened. One,
sadly, is that Tillis'’s team was knocked out of the
championship. The other was that Candace Parker
became the first woman ever to win the basketball
dunking championship—against five men.

Character, heart, the mind of a champion. It’s what
makes great athletes and it’s what comes from the
growth mindset with its focus on self-development,
self-motivation, and responsibility.

Even though the finest athletes are wildly com-
petitive and want to be the best, greatness does not
come from the ego of the fixed mindset, with its
somebody-nobody syndrome. Many athletes with
the fixed mindset may have been “naturals’—but
you know what? As John Wooden says, we can’t re-

BUSINESS: MINDSET AND LEADERSHIP

ENRON AND THE TALENT MINDSET

In 2001 came the announcement that shocked the
corporate world. Enron—the corporate poster child,
the company of the future—had gone belly-up.
What happened? How did such spectacular promise
turn into such a spectacular disaster? Was it incom-
petence? Was it corruption?

It was mindset. According to Malcolm Gladwell,
writing in The New Yorker, American corporations
had become obsessed with talent. Indeed, the gurus
at McKinsey & Company, the premier management
consulting firm in the country, were insisting that
corporate success today requires the “talent mind-
set.” Just as there are naturals in sports, they main-

tained, there are naturals in business. Just as sports
teams write huge checks to sign outsized talent, so,
too, should corporations spare no expense in recruit-
ing talent, for this is the secret weapon, the key to
beating the competition.

As Gladwell writes, “This ‘talent mind-set’ is the
new orthodoxy of American management.” It cre-
ated the blueprint for the Enron culture—and sowed
the seeds of its demise.

Enron recruited big talent, mostly people with
fancy degrees, which is not in itself so bad. It paid
them big money, which is not that terrible. But by
putting complete faith in talent, Enron did a fatal
thing: It created a culture that worshiped talent,
thereby forcing its employees to look and act extra-
ordinarily talented. Basically, it forced them into the
fixed mindset. And we know a lot about that. We
know from our studies that people with the fixed
mindset do not admit and correct their deficiencies.

Remember the study where we interviewed stu-
dents from the University of Hong Kong, where
everything is in English? Students with the fixed
mindset were so worried about appearing deficient
that they refused to take a course that would im-

prove their English. They did not live in a psycho-
logical world where they could take this risk.

And remember how we put students into a fixed
mindset by praising their intelligence—much as
Enron had done with its star employees? Later, after
some hard problems, we asked the students to write
a letter to someone in another school describing
their experience in our study. When we read their
letters, we were shocked: Almost 40 percent of them
had lied about their scores—always in the upward
direction. The fixed mindset had made a flaw in-
tolerable.

Gladwell concludes that when people live in an
environment that esteems them for their innate tal-
ent, they have grave difficulty when their image is
threatened: “They will not take the remedial course.
They will not stand up to investors and the public
and admit that they were wrong. They'd sooner lie.”

Obviously, a company that cannot self-correct can-
not thrive.

If Enron was done in by its fixed mindset, does
it follow that companies that thrive have a growth
mindset? Let’s see.

ORGANIZATIONS THAT GROW

Jim Collins set out to discover what made some com-
panies move from being good to being great. What
was it that allowed them to make the leap to great-
ness—and stay there—while other, comparable com-
panies just held steady at good?

To answer this question, he and his research team
embarked on a five-year study. They selected eleven
companies whose stock returns had skyrocketed
relative to other companies in their industry, and
who had maintained this edge for at least fifteen
years. They matched each company to another one
in the same industry that had similar resources, but
did not make the leap. He also studied a third group
of companies: ones that had made a leap from good
to great but did not sustain it.

What distinguished the thriving companies from
the others? There were several important factors, as
Collins reports in his book, Good to Great, but one
that was absolutely key was the type of leader who
in every case led the company into greatness. These

were not the larger-than-life, charismatic types who
oozed ego and self-proclaimed talent. They were
self-effacing people who constantly asked questions
and had the ability to confront the most brutal an-
swers—that is, to look failures in the face, even their
own, while maintaining faith that they would suc-
ceed in the end.

Does this sound familiar? Collins wonders why his
effective leaders have these particular qualities. And
why these qualities go together the way they do.
And how these leaders came to acquire them. But
we know. They have the growth mindset. They be-
lieve in human development. And these are the hall-
marks:

They’re not constantly trying to prove they’re bet-
ter than others. For example, they don’t highlight
the pecking order with themselves at the top, they
don’t claim credit for other people's contributions,
and they don’t undermine others to feel powerful.

Instead, they are constantly trying to improve.
They surround themselves with the most able
people they can find, they look squarely at their own
mistakes and deficiencies, and they ask frankly what
skills they and the company will need in the future.

And because of this, they can move forward with
confidence that’s grounded in the facts, not built on
fantasies about their talent.

Collins reports that Alan Wurtzel, the CEO of the
giant electronics chain Circuit City, held debates in
his boardroom. Rather than simply trying to im-
press his board of directors, he used them to learn.
With his executive team as well, he questioned, de-
bated, prodded until he slowly gained a clearer pic-
ture of where the company was and where it needed
to go. “They used to call me the prosecutor, because
I would hone in on a question,” Wurtzel told Collins.
“You know, like a bulldog. 1 wouldn’t let go until I
understood. Why, why, why?”

Wurtzel considered himself a “plow horse,” a hard-
working, no-nonsense normal kind of guy, but he
took a company that was close to bankruptcy and
over the next fifteen years turned it into one that de-
livered the highest total return to its stockholders of
any firm on the New York Stock Exchange.

A STUDY OF MINDSET AND
MANAGEMENT DECISIONS

Robert Wood and Albert Bandura did a fascinating
study with graduate students in business, many of
whom had management experience. In their study,
they created Enron-type managers and Wurtzel-type
managers by putting people into different mindsets.

Wood and Bandura gave these budding business
leaders a complex management task in which they
had to run a simulated organization, a furniture
company. In this computerized task, they had to
place employees in the right jobs and decide how
best to guide and motivate these workers. To dis-
cover the best ways, they had to keep revising their
decisions based on the feedback they got about em-
ployee productivity.

The researchers divided the business students into
two groups. One group was given a fixed mindset.
They were told that the task measured their basic,
underlying capabilities. The higher their capacity,
the better their performance. The other group was

given a growth mindset. They were told that man-
agement skills were developed through practice and
that the task would give them an opportunity to cul-
tivate these skills.

The task was hard because students were given
high production standards to meet, and—especially
in their early attempts—they fell short. As at Enron,
those with the fixed mindset did not profit from
their mistakes.

But those with the growth mindset kept on learn-
ing. Not worried about measuring—or protecting
—their fixed abilities, they looked directly at their
mistakes, used the feedback, and altered their strat-
egies accordingly. They became better and better at
understanding how to deploy and motivate their
workers, and their productivity kept pace. In fact,
they ended up way more productive than those with
the fixed mindset. What’s more, throughout this ra-
ther grueling task, they maintained a healthy sense
of confidence. They operated like Alan Wurtzel.

LEADERSHIP AND THE FIXED MINDSET

In contrast to Alan Wurtzel, the leaders of Collins's
comparison companies had every symptom of the
fixed mindset writ large.

Fixed-mindset leaders, like fixed-mindset people in
general, live in a world where some people are su-
perior and some are inferior. They must repeatedly
affirm that they are superior, and the company is
simply a platform for this.

Collins's comparison leaders were typically con-
cerned with their “reputation for personal great-
ness’—so much so that they often set the company
up to fail when their regime ended. As Collins puts
it, “After all, what better testament to your own per-
sonal greatness than that the place falls apart after
you leave?”

In more than two-thirds of these leaders, the re-
searchers saw a “gargantuan personal ego” that ei-
ther hastened the demise of the company or kept it
second-rate. Once such leader was Lee Iacocca, head
of Chrysler, who achieved a miraculous turnaround

for his company, then spent so much time grooming
his fame that in the second half of his tenure, the
company plunged back into mediocrity.

Many of these comparison companies operated on
what Collins calls a “genius with a thousand help-
ers” model. Instead of building an extraordinary
management team like the good-to-great compan-
ies, they operated on the fixed-mindset premise that
great geniuses do not need great teams. They just
need little helpers to carry out their brilliant ideas.

Don’t forget that these great geniuses don’t want
great teams, either. Fixed-mindset people want to be
the only big fish so that when they compare them-
selves to those around them, they can feel a cut
above the rest. In not one autobiography of a fixed-
mindset CEO did I read much about mentoring or
employee development programs. In every growth-
mindset autobiography, there was deep concern
with personnel development and extensive discus-
sion of it.

Finally, as with Enron, the geniuses refused to look
at their deficiencies. Says Collins: The good-to-great
Kroger grocery chain looked bravely at the danger
signs in the 1970s—signs that the old-fashioned

grocery store was becoming extinct. Meanwhile, its
counterpart, A&P, once the largest retailing organ-
ization in the world, shut its eyes. For example, when
A&P opened a new kind of store, a superstore, and it
seemed to be more successful than the old kind, they
closed it down. It was not what they wanted to hear.
In contrast, Kroger eliminated or changed every sin-
gle store that did not fit the new superstore model
and by the end of the 1990s it had become the num-
ber one grocery chain in the country.

CEOs and the Big Ego

How did CEO and gargantuan ego become synonym-
ous? If it’s the more self-effacing growth-minded
people who are the true shepherds of industry, why
are so many companies out looking for larger-than-
life leaders—even when these leaders may in the end
be more committed to themselves than to the com-
pany?

Blame Iacocca. According to James Surowiecki,
writing in Slate, Iacocca’s rise to prominence was
a turning point for American business. Before him,
the days of tycoons and moguls seemed long past. In

the public’s mind, CEO meant “a buttoned-down or-
ganization man, well-treated and well-paid, but es-
sentially bland and characterless.” With Iacocca, all
of that changed. Business journalists began dubbing
executives “the next J. P. Morgan” or “the next Henry
Ford.” And fixed-mindset executives started vying
for those labels.

Surowiecki even traces the recent corporate scan-
dals to this change, for as the trend continued, CEOs
became superheroes. But the people who preen their
egos and look for the next self-image boost are not
the same people who foster long-term corporate
health.

Maybe Iacocca is just a charismatic guy who, like
rock and roll, is being blamed for the demise of civ-
ilization. Is that fair? Let’s look at him more closely.
And let’s look at some other fixed-mindset CEOs:
Albert Dunlap of Scott Paper and Sunbeam; Jerry
Levin and Steve Case of AOL Time Warner; and Ken-
neth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling of Enron.

You'll see they all start with the belief that some
people are superior; they all have the need to prove
and display their superiority; they all use their sub-
ordinates to feed this need, rather than fostering the

development of their workers; and they all end by
sacrificing their companies to this need. The fixed
mindset helps us understand where gargantuan
egos come from, how they operate, and why they be-
come self-defeating.

FIXED-MINDSET LEADERS IN ACTION
Iacocca: I’m a Hero

Warren Bennis, the leadership guru, studied the
world’s greatest corporate leaders. These great
leaders said they didn't set out to be leaders. They’d
had no interest in proving themselves. They just did
what they loved—with tremendous drive and en-
thusiasm—and it led where it led.

Tacocca wasn’t like that. Yes, he loved the car
business, but more than anything he yearned to be
a muckamuck at Ford. He craved the approval of
Henry Ford Il and the royal trappings of office. These
were the things he could measure himself by, the
things that would prove he was somebody. I use the
term royal with good reason. Iacocca tells us the

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

Glass House, Ford corporate headquarters, was a pal-
ace and Henry Ford was the king. What’s more, “If
Henry was king, I was the crown prince.” “I was His
Majesty’s special protégé.” “All of us...lived the good
life in the royal court. We were part of something be-
yond first class—royal class....White coated waiters
were on call throughout the day, and we all ate lunch
together in the executive dining room...Dover sole
was flown over from England on a daily basis.”

Iacocca achieved great things at Ford, like nurt-
uring and promoting the Ford Mustang, and he
dreamed of succeeding Henry Ford as the CEO of the
company. But Henry Ford had other ideas and, much
to Iacocca’s shock and rage, he eventually forced Ia-
cocca out. It’s interesting that Iacocca was shocked
and that he harbored an enduring rage against
Henry Ford. After all, he had seen Henry Ford fire
top people, and he, Iacocca, had used the ax quite
liberally on others. He knew the corporate game. Yet
his fixed mindset clouded his vision: “I had always
clung to the idea that I was different, that somehow
I was smarter or luckier than the rest. I didn’t think it
would ever happen to me.” (Italics added.)

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

His belief in his inherent superiority had blinded
him. Now the other side of the fixed mindset kicked
in. He wondered whether Henry Ford had detected a
flaw in him. Maybe he wasn’t superior after all. And
that’s why he couldn't let go. Years later, his second
wife told him to get over it. “You don’t realize what
a favor Henry Ford did for you. Getting fired from
Ford brought you to greatness. You're richer, more
famous and more influential because of Henry Ford.
Thank him.” Shortly thereafter, he divorced her.

So the king who had defined him as competent and
worthy now rejected him as flawed. With ferocious
energy, Iacocca applied himself to the monumen-
tal task of saving face and, in the process, Chrysler
Motors. Chrysler, the once thriving Ford rival, was
on the brink of death, but Iacocca as its new CEO
acted quickly to hire the right people, bring out new
models, and lobby the government for bailout loans.
Just a few years after his humiliating exit from Ford,
he was able to write a triumphant autobiography
and init declare, “Today, I'ma hero.”

Within a short time, however, Chrysler was in
trouble again. Iacocca’s fixed mindset would not stay
put. He needed to prove his greatness—to himself,

to Henry Ford, to the world—on a larger and lar-
ger scale. He spent his company time on things
that would enhance his public image, and he spent
the company’s money on things that would impress
Wall Street and hike up Chrysler's stock prices. But
he did this instead of investing in new car designs or
manufacturing improvements that would keep the
company profitable in the long run.

He also looked to history, to how he would be
judged and remembered. But he did not address this
concern by building the company. Quite the con-
trary. According to one of his biographers, he wor-
ried that his underlings might get credit for success-
ful new designs, so he balked at approving them.
He worried, as Chrysler faltered, that his underlings
might be seen as the new saviors, so he tried to get
rid of them. He worried that he would be written
out of Chrysler history, so he desperately hung on as
CEO long after he had lost his effectiveness.

Iacocca had a golden opportunity to make a differ-
ence, to leave a great legacy. The American auto
industry was facing its biggest challenge ever. Japan-
ese imports were taking over the American market.
It was simple: They looked better and they ran bet-

ter. Iacocca’s own people had done a detailed study of
Honda, and made excellent suggestions to him.

But rather than taking up the challenge and de-
livering better cars, Iacocca, mired in his fixed mind-
set, delivered blame and excuses. He went on the
rampage, spewing angry diatribes against the Japan-
ese and demanding that the American government
impose tariffs and quotas that would stop them.
In an editorial against Iacocca, The New York Times
scolded, “The solution lies in making better cars in
this country, not in angrier excuses about Japan.”

Nor was Iacocca growing as a leader of his work-
force. In fact, he was shrinking into the insulated,
petty, and punitive tyrant he had accused Henry
Ford of being. Not only was he firing people who
were critical of him, he’d done little to reward the
workers who had sacrificed so much to save the
company. Even when the money was rolling in, he
seemed to have little interest in sharing it with
them. Their pay remained low and their working
conditions remained poor. Yet even when Chrysler
was in trouble again, he maintained a regal lifestyle.
Two million dollars were spent renovating his cor-
porate suite at the Waldorf in New York.

Finally, while there was still time to save Chrysler,
the board of directors eased Iacocca out. They gave
him a grand pension, showered him with stock op-
tions, and continued many of his corporate perks.
But he was beside himself with rage, especially since
his successor seemed to be managing the company
quite nicely. So in a bid to regain the throne, he
joined a hostile takeover attempt, one that placed
the future of Chrysler at risk. It failed. But for many,
the suspicion that he put his ego before the welfare
of the company was confirmed.

Iacocca lived the fixed mindset. Although he
started out loving the car business and having
breakthrough ideas, his need to prove his superior-
ity started to dominate, eventually killing his en-
joyment and stifling his creativity. As time went on
and he became less and less responsive to challenges
from competitors, he resorted to the key weapons of
the fixed mindset—blame, excuses, and the stifling
of critics and rivals.

‘And as is so often the case with the fixed mindset,
because of these very things, Iacocca lost the valid-
ation he craved.

When students fail tests or athletes lose games,
it tells them that they’ve dropped the ball. But the
power that CEOs wield allows them to create a world
that caters night and day to their need for validation.
It allows them to surround themselves only with
the good news of their perfection and the company’s
success, no matter what the warning signs may be.
This, as you may recall, is CEO disease and a peril of
the fixed mindset.

You know, lately I've wondered whether Iaco-
cca has recuperated from CEO disease. He's raising
money (and giving a lot of his own) for innovative
diabetes research. He’s working for the development
of environment-friendly vehicles. Maybe, released
from the task of trying to prove himself, he’s now
going for things he deeply values.

One hundred million for little more than a year and
a half of work. “Did I earn it? Damn right I did. I’m
a superstar in my field, much like Michael Jordan in
basketball and Bruce Springsteen in rock’n’ roll.”

Iacocca paid lip service to teamwork, the import-

Dunlap didn’t even pay lip service: “If you're in
business, you're in business for one thing—to make
money.”

He proudly reports an incident at an employee
meeting at Scott Paper. A woman stood up and
asked, “Now that the company is improving, can we
restart charitable donations?” To which he replied,
“If you want to give on your own, that is your busi-
ness and I encourage you to do it. But this company
is here to make a buck....The answer, in a word, is
no.”

I'm not here to argue that business isn’t about
money, but I do want to ask: Why was Dunlap so fo-
cused on it?

Let’s let him tell us. “Making my way in the world
became a matter of self-respect for me, of a kid try-
ing to prove he was worth something....To this day,

I feel I have to prove and reprove myself.” And if he
has to prove himself, he needs a yardstick. Employee
satisfaction or community responsibility or char-
itable contributions are not good yardsticks. They
cannot be reduced to one number that represents his
self-worth. But shareholder profits can.

In his own words, “The most ridiculous term
heard in boardrooms these days is ‘stakeholders
The term refers to the employees, the community,
and the other companies, such as suppliers, that the
company deals with. “You can't measure success by
the interest of multiple stakeholders. You can meas-
ure success by how the shareholder fares.”

The long haul held no interest for Dunlap. Really
learning about a company and figuring out how to
make it grow didn’t give him the big blast of super-
hero juice. “Eventually, I have gotten bored every
place I have been.” In his book, there is a whole
chapter called “Impressing the Analysts,” but there
isno chapter about making a business work. In other
words, it’s always about Dunlap proving his genius.

Then in 1996, Dunlap took over Sunbeam. In his
typical “Chainsaw Al” style, he closed or sold two-
thirds of Sunbeam’s plants and fired half of the

twelve thousand employees. Ironically, the Sunbeam
stock rose so high, it ruined his plan to sell the com-
pany. It was too expensive to buy! Uh-oh, now he had
torun the company. Now he had to keep it profitable,
or at least looking profitable. But instead of turn-
ing to his staff or learning what to do, he inflated
revenues, fired people who questioned him, and
covered up the increasingly dire straits his company
was in. Less than two years after the self-proclaimed
superstardom in his book (and one year after an
even more self-congratulatory revision), Dunlap fell
apart and was kicked out. As he left, Sunbeam was
under investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and was expected to be in technical de-
fault on a $1.7 billion bank loan.

Dunlap deeply misunderstood Michael Jordan and
Bruce Springsteen. Both of these superstars reached
the pinnacle and stayed there a long time because
they constantly dug down, faced challenges, and
kept growing. Al Dunlap thought that he was inher-
ently superior, so he opted out of the kind of learning
that would have helped him succeed.

The Smartest Guys in the Room

Yes, it seems as though history led inevitably from
Iacocca to the moguls of the 1990s, and none more
so than Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling, the leaders
of Enron.

Ken Lay, the company’s founder, chairman, and
CEO, considered himself a great visionary. Accord-
ing to Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind, authors of
The Smartest Guys in the Room, Lay looked down his
nose at the people who actually made the company
run, much the way a king might look at his serfs. He
looked down on Rich Kinder, the Enron president,
who rolled up his sleeves and tried to make sure
the company would reach its earning targets. Kinder
was the man who made Lay’s royal lifestyle possible.
Kinder was also the only person at the top who con-
stantly asked if they were fooling themselves: “Are
we smoking our own dope? Are we drinking our own.
whiskey?”

Naturally, his days were numbered. But in his sens-
ible and astute way, as he departed he arranged to
buy the one Enron asset that was inherently valu-

able, the energy pipelines—the asset that Enron held
in disdain. By the middle of 2003, Kinder’s company
had a market value of seven billion dollars.

Even as Lay was consumed by his view of him-
self and the regal manner in which he wished to
support it, he wanted to be seen as a “good and
thoughtful man” with a credo of respect and integ-
rity. Even as Enron merrily sucked the life out of
its victims, he wrote to his staff, “Ruthlessness, cal-
lousness and arrogance don’t belong here.... We work
with customers and prospects openly, honestly and
sincerely.” As with Iacocca and the others, the per-
ception—usually Wall Street's perception—was all-
important. The reality less so.

Right there with Lay was Jeff Skilling, successor to
Rich Kinder as president and chief operating officer,
and later the CEO. Skilling was not just smart, he
was said to be “the smartest person I ever met” and
“incandescently brilliant.” He used his brainpower,
however, not to learn but to intimidate. When he
thought he was smarter than others, which was al-
most always, he treated them harshly. And anyone
who disagreed with him was just not bright enough
to “get it.” When a co-CEO with superb management

skills was brought in to help Skilling during a hard
time in his life, Skilling was contemptuous of him:
“Ron doesn’t get it.” When financial analysts or Wall
Street traders tried to press Skilling to go beyond his
pat explanations, he treated them as though they
were stupid. “Well, it’s so obvious. How can you not
get it?” In most cases, the Wall Street guys, ever con-
cerned about their own intellect, made believe they
gotit.

As resident genius, Skilling had unlimited faith in
his ideas. He had so much regard for his ideas that
he believed Enron should be able to proclaim profits
as soon as he or his people had the idea that might
lead to profits. This is a radical extension of the fixed
mindset: My genius not only defines and validates me.
It defines and validates the company. It is what creates
value. My genius is profit. Wow!

And in fact, this is how Enron came to operate. As
McLean and Elkind report, Enron recorded “millions
of dollars in profits on a business before it had gener-
ated a penny in actual revenues.” Of course, after the
creative act no one cared about follow-through. That
was beneath them. So, often as not, the profit never
occurred. If genius equaled profit, it didn’t matter

that Enron people sometimes wasted millions com-
peting against each other. Said Amanda Martin, an
Enron executive, “To put one over on one of your
own was a sign of creativity and greatness.”

Skilling not only thought he was smarter than
everyone else but, like Iacocca, also thought he was
luckier. According to insiders, he thought he could
beat the odds. Why should he feel vulnerable? There
was never anything wrong. Skilling still does not
admit that there was anything wrong. The world
simply didn’t get it.

Two Geniuses Collide

Resident geniuses almost brought down AOL and
Time Warner, too. Steve Case of AOL and Jerry Levin
of Time Warner were two CEOs with the fixed mind-
set who merged their companies. Can you see it com-
ing?

Case and Levin had a lot in common. Both of
them cultivated an aura of supreme intelligence.
Both tried to intimidate people with their brilliance.
And both were known to take more credit than they
deserved. As resident geniuses, neither wanted to

hear complaints, and both were ready to fire people
who weren't “team players,” meaning people who
wouldn't keep up the facade that they had erected.

When the merger actually took place, AOL was
in such debt that the merged company was on the
brink of ruin. You would think that the two CEOs
might work together, marshaling their resources to
save the company they created. Instead, Levin and
Case scrambled for personal power.

Levin was the first to fall. But Case was still not try-
ing to make things work. In fact, when the new CEO,
Richard Parsons, sent someone down to fix AOL,
Case was intensely against it. If someone else fixed
AOL, someone else would get the credit. As with Ia-
cocca, better to let the company collapse than let
another prince be crowned. When Case was finally
counseled to resign, he was furious. Like Iacocca,
he denied all responsibility for the company’s prob-
lems and vowed to get back at those who had turned
against him.

Because of the resident geniuses, AOL Time
Warner ended the year 2002 with a loss of almost
one hundred billion dollars. It was the largest yearly
loss in American history.

Invulnerable, Invincible, and Entitled

Iacocca, Dunlap, Lay and Skilling, Case and Levin.
They show what can happen when people with the
fixed mindset are put in charge of companies. In
each case, a brilliant man put his company in jeop-
ardy because measuring himself and his legacy out-
weighed everything else. They were not evil in the
usual sense. They didn’t set out to do harm. But at
critical decision points, they opted for what would
make them feel good and look good over what would
serve the longer-term corporate goals. Blame others,
cover mistakes, pump up the stock prices, crush
rivals and critics, screw the little guy—these were
the standard operating procedures.

What is fascinating is that as they led their com-
panies toward ruin, all of these leaders felt invul-
nerable and invincible. In many cases, they were
in highly competitive industries, facing onslaughts
from fierce rivals. But they lived in a different reality.

It was a world of personal greatness and entitle-
ment. Kenneth Lay felt a powerful sense of entitle-
ment, Even as he was getting millions a year in

compensation from Enron, he took large personal
loans from the company, gave jobs and contracts to
his relatives, and used the corporate jets as his fam-
ily fleet. Even during bad years at Chrysler, Iaco-
cca threw lavish Christmas parties for the company
elite. At every party, as king, he presented himself
with an expensive gift, which the executives were
later billed for. Speaking about AOL executives, a
former official said, “You're talking about men who
thought they had a right to anything.”

As these leaders cloaked themselves in the trap-
pings of royalty, surrounded themselves with flat-
terers who extolled their virtues, and hid from
problems, it is no wonder they felt invincible. Their
fixed mindset created a magic realm in which the
brilliance and perfection of the king were constantly
validated. Within that mindset, they were com-
pletely fulfilled. Why would they want to step out-
side that realm to face the uglier reality of warts and
failures?

As Morgan McCall, in his book High Flyers, points
out, “Unfortunately, people often like the things that
work against their growth....People like to use their
strengths...to achieve quick, dramatic results, even

if...they aren’t developing the new skills they will
need later on. People like to believe they are as good
as everyone says...and not take their weaknesses as
seriously as they might. People don't like to hear bad
news or get criticism....There is tremendous risk...
in leaving what one does well to attempt to master
something new.” And the fixed mindset makes it
seem all that much riskier.

Brutal Bosses

McCall goes on to point out that when leaders feel
they are inherently better than others, they may
start to believe that the needs or feelings of the lesser
people can be ignored. None of our fixed-mindset
leaders cared much about the little guy, and many
were outright contemptuous of those beneath them
on the corporate ladder. Where does this lead? In the
guise of “keeping people on their toes,” these bosses
may mistreat workers.

Iacocca played painful games with his executives
to keep them off balance. Jerry Levin of Time Warner
was likened by his colleagues to the brutal Roman

emperor Caligula. Skilling was known for his harsh
ridicule of those less intelligent than he.

Harvey Hornstein, an expert on corporate leader-
ship, writes in his book Brutal Bosses that this kind of
abuse represents the bosses’ desire “to enhance their
own feelings of power, competence, and value at
the subordinate’s expense.” Do you remember in our
studies how people with the fixed mindset wanted
to compare themselves with people who were worse
off than they were? The principle is the same, but
there is an important difference: These bosses have
the power to make people worse off. And when they
do, they feel better about themselves.

Hornstein describes Paul Kazarian, the former CEO
of Sunbeam-Oster. He called himself a “perfection-
ist,” but that was a euphemism for “abuser.” He
threw things at subordinates when they upset him.
One day, the comptroller, after displeasing Mr. Kaz-
arian, saw an orange juice container flying toward
him.

Sometimes the victims are people the bosses con-
sider to be less talented. This can feed their sense
of superiority. But often the victims are the most
competent people, because these are the ones who

pose the greatest threat to a fixed-mindset boss. An
engineer at a major aircraft builder, interviewed by
Hornstein, talked about his boss: “His targets were
usually those of us who were most competent. I
mean, if you're really concerned about our perform-
ance, you don’t pick on those who are performing
best.” But if you're really concerned about your com-
petence, you do.

When bosses mete out humiliation, a change
comes over the place. Everything starts revolving
around pleasing the boss. In Good to Great, Collins
notes that in many of his comparison companies
(the ones that didn’t go from good to great, or that
went there and declined again), the leader became
the main thing people worried about. “The minute
a leader allows himself to become the primary real-
ity people worry about, rather than reality being the
primary reality, you have a recipe for mediocrity, or
worse.”

In the 1960s and ’70s, the Chase Manhattan Bank
was ruled by David Rockefeller, an excessively con-
trolling leader. According to Collins and Porras in
Built to Last, his managers lived day to day in fear
of his disapproval. At the end of each day, they

breathed a sigh of relief: “Whew! One more day gone
and I’m not in trouble.” Even long past his heyday,
senior managers refused to venture a new idea be-
cause “David might not like it.” Ray Macdonald of
Burroughs, Collins and Porras report, publicly ridi-
culed managers for mistakes to the point where he
inhibited them from innovating. As a result, even
though Burroughs was ahead of IBM in the early
stages of the computer industry, the company lost
out. The same thing happened at Texas Instruments,
another leader in the exciting early days of the com-
puter. If they didn’t like a presentation, Mark Shep-
herd and Fred Bucy would yell, bang on tables, insult
the speaker, and hurl things. No wonder their people
lost their enterprising spirit.

When bosses become controlling and abusive, they
put everyone into a fixed mindset. This means that
instead of learning, growing, and moving the com-
pany forward, everyone starts worrying about being
judged. It starts with the bosses’ worry about being
judged, but it winds up being everybody’s fear about
being judged. It’s hard for courage and innovation to
survive a companywide fixed mindset.

GROWTH-MINDSET LEADERS IN ACTION

Andrew Carnegie once said, “I wish to have as my
epitaph: ‘Here lies a man who was wise enough to
bring into his service men who knew more than he.’”

Okay, let’s open the windows and let some air
in. The fixed mindset feels so stifling. Even when
those leaders are globe-trotting and hobnobbing
with world figures, their world seems so small and
confining—because their minds are always on one
thing: Validate me!

When you enter the world of the growth-mind-
set leaders, everything changes. It brightens, it ex-
pands, it fills with energy, with possibility. You
think, Gee, that seems like fun! It has never entered
my mind to lead a corporation, but when I learned
about what these leaders had done, it sounded like
the most exciting thing in the world.

I’ve chosen three of these leaders to explore as a
contrast to the fixed-mindset leaders. I chose Jack
Welch of General Electric because he is a larger-
than-life figure with an ego he held in check—not

your straight-ahead naturally self-effacing growth-
minded guy. And I chose Lou Gerstner (the man
who came in and saved IBM) and Anne Mulcahy (the
woman who brought Xerox back to life) as contrasts
to Alfred Dunlap, the other turnaround expert.

Jack Welch, Lou Gerstner, and Anne Mulcahy are
also fascinating because they transformed their
companies. They did this by rooting out the fixed
mindset and putting a culture of growth and team-
work in its place. With Gerstner and IBM, it’s
like watching Enron morph into a growth-mindset
mecca.

As growth-minded leaders, they start with a belief
in human potential and development—both their
own and other people's. Instead of using the com-
pany asa vehicle for their greatness, they use it as an
engine of growth—for themselves, the employees,
and the company as a whole.

Warren Bennis has said that too many bosses are
driven and driving but going nowhere. Not these
people. They don’t talk royalty. They talk journey. An
inclusive, learning-filled, rollicking journey.

Jack: Listening, Crediting, Nurturing

When Jack Welch took over GE in 1980, the company
was valued at fourteen billion dollars. Twenty years
later, it was valued by Wall Street at $490 billion.
It was the most valuable company in the world.
Fortune magazine called Welch “the most widely ad-
mired, studied, and imitated CEO of his time....His
total economic impact is impossible to calculate but
must be a staggering multiple of his GE perform-
ance.”

But to me even more impressive was an op-ed piece
in The New York Times by Steve Bennett, the CEO of
Intuit. “I learned about nurturing employees from
my time at General Electric from Jack Welch....He’d
go directly to the front-line employee to figure out
what was going on. Sometime in the early 1990s,
I saw him in a factory where they made refriger-
ators in Louisville....He went right to the workers
in the assembly line to hear what they had to say. I
do frequent CEO chats with front-line employees. I
learned that from Jack.”

This vignette says a lot. Jack was obviously a busy
guy. An important guy. But he didn’t run things
like Iacocca—from the luxurious corporate head-
quarters where his most frequent contacts were the
white-gloved waiters. Welch never stopped visiting
the factories and hearing from the workers. These
were people he respected, learned from, and, in turn,
nurtured.

Then there is the emphasis on teamwork, not the
royal I. Right away—right from the “Dedication” and
the “Author's Note” of Welch’s autobiography—you
know something is different. It’s not the “I'm a hero”
of Lee Iacocca or the “I’m a superstar” of Alfred Dun-
lap—although he could easily lay claim to both.

Instead, it’s “I hate having to use the first person.
Nearly everything I’ve done in my life has been
accomplished with other people....Please remember
that every time you see the word I in these pages, it
refers to all those colleagues and friends and some I
might have missed.”

and learning. They often made me look better than I

Already we see the me me me of the validation-
hungry CEO becoming the we and us of the growth-
minded leader.

Interestingly, before Welch could root the fixed
mindset out of the company, he had to root it out of
himself. And believe me, Welch had a long way to
go. He was not always the leader he learned to be. In
1971, Welch was being considered for a promotion
when the head of GE human resources wrote a cau-
tioning memo. He noted that despite Welch’s many
strengths, the appointment “carries with it more
than the usual degree of risk.” He went on to say that
Welch was arrogant, couldn't take criticism, and de-
pended too much on his talent instead of hard work
and his knowledgeable staff. Not good signs.

Fortunately, every time his success went to his
head, he got a wake-up call. One day, young “Dr.”
Welch, decked out in his fancy suit, got into his new
convertible. He proceeded to put the top down and
was promptly squirted with dark, grungy oil that ru-
ined both his suit and the paint job on his beloved
car. “There I was, thinking I was larger than life, and
smack came the reminder that brought me back to
reality. It was a great lesson.”

There is a whole chapter titled “Too Full of Myself”
about the time he was on an acquisition roll and
felt he could do no wrong. Then he bought Kidder,
Peabody, a Wall Street investment banking firm with
an Enron-type culture. It was a disaster that lost
hundreds of millions of dollars for GE. “The Kidder
experience never left me.” It taught him that “there's
only a razor’s edge between self-confidence and hu-
bris. This time hubris won and taught me a lesson I
would never forget.”

What he learned was this: True self-confidence is
“the courage to be open—to welcome change and
new ideas regardless of their source.” Real self-confi-
dence is not reflected in a title, an expensive suit, a
fancy car, or a series of acquisitions. It is reflected in
your mindset: your readiness to grow.

Well, humility is a start, but what about the man-
agement skills?

From his experiences, Welch learned more and
more about the kind of manager he wanted to be:
a growth-minded manager—a guide, not a judge.
When Welch was a young engineer at GE, he caused
a chemical explosion that blew the roof off the
building he worked in. Emotionally shaken by what

happened, he nervously drove the hundred miles to
company headquarters to face the music and ex-
plain himself to the boss. But when he got there, the
treatment he received was understanding and sup-
portive. He never forgot it. “Charlie's reaction made
a huge impression on me....If we're managing good
people who are clearly eating themselves up over an
error, our job is to help them through it.”

He learned how to select people: for their mind-
set, not their pedigrees. Originally, academic pedi-
grees impressed him. He hired engineers from MIT,
Princeton, and Caltech. But after a while, he realized
that wasn’t what counted. “Eventually I learned that
I was really looking for people who were filled with
passion and a desire to get things done. A resume
didn’t tell me much about that inner hunger.”

Then came a chance to become the CEO. Each of
the three candidates had to convince the reigning
CEO he was best for the job. Welch made the pitch on
the basis of his capacity to grow. He didn’t claim that
he was a genius or that he was the greatest leader
who ever lived. He promised to develop. He got the
job and made good on his promise.

Immediately, he opened up dialogue and the chan-
nels for honest feedback. He quickly set to work
asking executives what they liked and disliked about
the company and what they thought needed chan-
ging. Boy, were they surprised. In fact, they’d been
so used to kissing up to the bosses that they couldn’t
even get their minds around these questions.

Then he spread the word: This company is about
growth, not self-importance.

He shut down elitism—quite the opposite of
our fixed-mindset leaders. One evening, Welch ad-
dressed an elite executive club at GE that was the
place for movers and shakers to see and be seen. To
their shock, he did not tell them how wonderful they
were. He told them, “I can’t find any value in what
you're doing.” Instead, he asked them to think of a
role that made more sense for them and for the com-
pany. A month later, the president of the club came
to Welch with a new idea: to turn the club into a
force of community volunteers. Twenty years later
that program, open to all employees, had forty-two
thousand members. They were running mentoring
programs in inner-city schools and building parks,
playgrounds, and libraries for communities in need.

They were now making a contribution to others’
growth, not to their own egos.

He got rid of brutal bosses. Iacocca tolerated and
even admired brutal bosses who could make the
workers produce. It served his bottom line. Welch
admitted that he, too, had often looked the other
way. But in the organization he now envisioned, he
could not do that. In front of five hundred managers,
“I explained why four corporate officers were asked
to leave during the prior year—even though they
delivered good financial performance....[They] were
asked to go because they didn’t practice our values.”
The approved way to foster productivity was now
through mentoring, not through terror.

And he rewarded teamwork rather than individual
genius. For years, GE, like Enron, had rewarded the
single originator of an idea, but now Welch wanted
to reward the team that brought the ideas to fru-
ition. “As a result, leaders were encouraged to share
the credit for ideas with their teams rather than take
full credit themselves. It made a huge difference in
how we all related to one another.”

Jack Welch was not a perfect person, but he was de-
voted to growth. This devotion kept his ego in check,

prosperous and fulfilling for thousands of people.

Lou: Rooting Out the Fixed Mindset

By the late 1980s, IBM had become Enron, with one
exception. The board of directors knew it was in
trouble.

It had a culture of smugness and elitism. Within
the company, it was the old We are royalty, but I’m
more royal than you are syndrome. There was no
teamwork, only turf wars. There were deals but no
follow-up. There was no concern for the customer.
Yet this probably wouldn't have bothered anyone if
business weren't suffering.

In 1993, they turned to Lou Gerstner and asked
him to be the new CEO. He said no. They asked him
again. “You owe it to America. We're going to have
President Clinton call and tell you to take the job.
Please, please, please. We want exactly the kind of
strategy and culture change you created at Ameri-
can Express and RJR.”

In the end he caved, although he can’t remember
why. But IBM now had a leader who believed in
personal growth and in creating a corporate culture
that would foster it. How did he produce it at IBM?

First, as Welch had done, he opened the channels
of communication up and down the company. Six
days after he arrived, he sent a memo to every IBM
worker, telling them: “Over the next few months, I
plan to visit as many of our operations and offices
as Ican. And whenever possible, I plan to meet with
many of you to talk about how together we can
strengthen the company.”

He dedicated his book to them: “This book is dedi-
cated to the thousands of IBMers who never gave up
on their company, their colleagues, and themselves.
They are the real heroes of the reinvention of IBM.”

As Welch had done, he attacked the elitism. Like
Enron, the whole culture was about grappling for
personal status within the company. Gerstner dis-
banded the management committee, the ultimate
power role for IBM executives, and often went out-
side the upper echelons for expertise. From a growth
mindset, it’s not only the select few that have some-
thing to offer. “Hierarchy means very little to me.

Let’s put together in meetings the people who can
help solve a problem, regardless of position.”

Then came teamwork. Gerstner fired politicians,
those who indulged in internal intrigue, and instead
rewarded people who helped their colleagues. He
stopped IBM sales divisions from putting each other
down to clients to win business for themselves. He
started basing executives’ bonuses more on IBM's
overall performance and less on the performance of
their individual units. The message: We're not look-
ing to crown a few princes; we need to work as a
team.

As at Enron, the deal was the glamorous thing; the
rest was pedestrian. Gerstner was appalled by the
endless failure to follow through on deals and deci-
sions, and the company’s unlimited tolerance of it.
He demanded and inspired better execution. Mes-
sage: Genius is not enough; we need to get the job
done.

Finally, Gerstner focused on the customer. IBM
customers felt betrayed and angry. IBM was so into
itself that it was no longer serving their computer
needs. They were upset about pricing. They were
frustrated by the bureaucracy at IBM. They were ir-

ritated that IBM was not helping them to integrate
their systems. At a meeting of 175 chief information
officers of the largest U.S. companies, Gerstner an-
nounced that IBM would now put the customer first
and backed it up by announcing a drastic cut in their
mainframe computer prices. Message: We are not
hereditary royalty; we serve at the pleasure of our
clients.

At the end of his first three arduous months, Ger-
stner received his report card from Wall Street: “[IBM
stock] has done nothing, because he has done noth-
ing.”

Ticked off but undaunted, Gerstner continued his
anti-royalty campaign and brought IBM back from
its “near-death experience.” This was the sprint.
This is when Dunlap would have taken his money
and run. What lay ahead was the even harder task of
maintaining his policies until IBM regained industry
leadership. That was the marathon. By the time he
gave IBM back to the IBMers in March 2002, the stock
had increased in value by 800 percent and IBM was
“number one in the world in IT services, hardware,
enterprise software (excluding PCs), and custom-de-
signed, high performance computer chips.” What's

more, IBM was once again defining the future direc-
tion of the industry.

Anne: Learning, Toughness, and Compassion

Take IBM. Plunge it into debt to the tune of seventeen
billion. Destroy its credit rating. Make it the target of
SEC investigations. And drop its stock from $63.69
to $4.43 a share. What do you get? Xerox.

That was the Xerox Anne Mulcahy took over in
2000. Not only had the company failed to diversify,
it could no longer even sell its copy machines. But
three years later, Xerox had had four straight profit-
able quarters, and in 2004 Fortune named Mulcahy
“the hottest turnaround act since Lou Gerstner.”
How did she do it?

She went into an incredible learning mode, mak-
ing herself into the CEO Xerox needed to survive.
She and her top people, like Ursula Burns, learned
the nitty-gritty of every part of the business. For
example, as Fortune writer Betsy Morris explains,
Mulcahy took Balance Sheet 101. She learned about
debt, inventory, taxes, and currency so she could
predict how each decision she made would play out

on the balance sheet. Every weekend, she took home
large binders and pored over them as though her
final exam was on Monday. When she took the helm,
people at Xerox units couldn't give her simple an-
swers about what they had, what they sold, or who
was in charge. She became a CEO who knew those
answers or knew where to get them.

She was tough. She told everyone the cold, hard
truth they didn’t want to know—like how the Xerox
business model was not viable or how close the
company was to running out of money. She cut the
employee rolls by 30 percent. But she was no Chain-
saw Al. Instead, she bore the emotional brunt of her
decisions, roaming the halls, hanging out with the
employees, and saying “I’m sorry.” She was tough
but compassionate. In fact, she'd wake up in the
middle of the night worrying about what would
happen to the remaining employees and retirees if
the company folded.

She worried constantly about the morale and de-
velopment of her people, so that even with the
cuts, she refused to sacrifice the unique and won-
derful parts of the Xerox culture. Xerox was known
throughout the industry as the company that gave

retirement parties and hosted retiree reunions. As
the employees struggled side by side with her, she
refused to abolish their raises and, in a morale-
boosting gesture, gave them all their birthdays off.
She wanted to save the company in body and spirit.
And not for herself or her ego, but for all her people
who were stretching themselves to the limit for the
company.

After slaving away for two years, Mulcahy opened
Time magazine only to see a picture of herself
grouped with the notorious heads of Tyco and
WorldCom, men responsible for two of the biggest
corporate management disasters of our time.

But a year later she knew her hard work was finally
paying off when one of her board members, the
former CEO of Procter & Gamble, told her, “I never
thought I would be proud to have my name associ-
ated with this company again. I was wrong.”

Mulcahy was winning the sprint. Next came the
marathon. Could Xerox win that, too? Maybe it
had rested on its laurels too long, resisting change
and letting too many chances go by. Or maybe the
growth mindset—Mulcahy’s mission to transform

American institution.

ership is about growth and passion, not about bril-
liance, The fixed-mindset leaders were, in the end,
full of bitterness, but the growth-minded leaders
were full of gratitude. They looked up with gratitude
to their workers who had made their amazing jour-
ney possible. They called them the real heroes.

Are CEO and Male Synonymous?

When you look at the books written by and about
CEOs, you would think so. Jim Collins's good-to-
great leaders (and his comparison to not-so-great
leaders) were all men. Perhaps that’s because men
are the ones who've been at the top for a long while.
A few years ago, you'd have been hard-pressed to
think of women at the top of big companies. In fact,
many women who've run big companies had to cre-
ate them, like Mary Kay Ash (the cosmetics tycoon),
Martha Stewart, or Oprah Winfrey. Or inherit them,

like Katharine Graham, the former head of The
Washington Post.

Things are beginning to change. Women now hold
more key positions in big business. They’ve been the
CEOs of not only Xerox, but also eBay, Hewlett-Pack-
ard, Viacom’s MTV Networks, Time Warner's Time,
Inc., Lucent Technologies, and Rite Aid. Women
have been the presidents or chief financial officers
of Citigroup, PepsiCo, and Verizon. In fact, Fortune
magazine called Meg Whitman of eBay “maybe...the
best CEO in America” of the “world’s hottest com-
pany.”

I wonder whether, in a few years, I'll be able to
write this whole chapter with women as the main
characters. On the other hand, Ihope not. hope that
in a few years, it will be hard to find fixed-mindset
leaders—men or women—at the top of our most im-
portant companies.

A STUDY OF GROUP PROCESSES

Researcher Robert Wood and his colleagues did an-
other great study. This time they created manage-

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

ment groups, thirty groups with three people each.
Half of the groups had three people with a fixed
mindset and half had three people with a growth
mindset.

Those with the fixed mindset believed that:
“People have a certain fixed amount of management
ability and they cannot do much to change it.” In
contrast, those with the growth mindset believed:
“People can always substantially change their basic
skills for managing other people.” So one group
thought that you have it or you don’t; the other
thought your skills could grow with experience.

Every group had worked together for some weeks
when they were given, jointly, the task I talked about
before: a complex management task in which they
ran a simulated organization, a furniture company.
If you remember, on this task people had to figure
out how to match workers with jobs and how to
motivate them for maximum productivity. But this
time, instead of working individually, people could
discuss their choices and the feedback they got, and
work together to improve their decisions.

The fixed- and growth-mindset groups started
with the same ability, but as time went on the

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

growth-mindset groups clearly outperformed the
fixed-mindset ones. And this difference became ever
larger the longer the groups worked. Once again,
those with the growth mindset profited from their
mistakes and feedback far more than the fixed-
mindset people. But what was even more interesting
was how the groups functioned.

The members of the growth-mindset groups were
much more likely to state their honest opinions and
openly express their disagreements as they commu-
nicated about their management decisions. Every-
‘one was part of the learning process. For the fixed-
mindset groups—with their concern about who was
smart or dumb or their anxiety about disapproval
for their ideas—that open, productive discussion did
not happen. Instead, it was more like groupthink.

GROUPTHINK VERSUS WE THINK

In the early 1970s, Irving Janis popularized the term
groupthink. It’s when everyone in a group starts
thinking alike. No one disagrees. No one takes a crit-
ical stance. It can lead to catastrophic decisions, and,

==================================================
Page 269
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

as the Wood study suggests, it often can come right
out of a fixed mindset.

Groupthink can occur when people put unlimited
faith in a talented leader, a genius. This is what led to
the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, America’s half-
baked secret plan to invade Cuba and topple Castro.
President Kennedy’s normally astute advisers sus-
pended their judgment. Why? Because they thought
he was golden and everything he did was bound to
succeed.

According to Arthur Schlesinger, an insider, the
men around Kennedy had unbounded faith in his
ability and luck. “Everything had broken right for
him since 1956. He had won the nomination and
the election against all the odds in the book. Every-
one around him thought he had the Midas touch and
could not lose.”

Schlesinger also said, “Had one senior advisor op-
posed the adventure, I believe that Kennedy would
have canceled it. No one spoke against it.” To prevent
this from happening to him, Winston Churchill set
up a special department. Others might be in awe of
his titanic persona, but the job of this department,
Jim Collins reports, was to give Churchill all the

worst news. Then Churchill could sleep well at night,
knowing he had not been groupthinked into a false
sense of security.

Groupthink can happen when the group gets car-
ried away with its brilliance and superiority. At
Enron, the executives believed that because they
were brilliant, all of their ideas were brilliant. Noth-
ing would ever go wrong. An outside consultant kept
asking Enron people, “Where do you think you're
vulnerable?” Nobody answered him. Nobody even
understood the question. “We got to the point,” said
a top executive, “where we thought we were bullet
proof.”

Alfred P. Sloan, the former CEO of General Motors,
presents a nice contrast. He was leading a group
of high-level policy makers who seemed to have
reached a consensus. “Gentlemen,” he said, “I take
it we are all in complete agreement on the decision
here....Then I propose we postpone further discus-
sion of this matter until our next meeting to give
ourselves time to develop disagreement and perhaps
gain some understanding of what the decision is all
about.”

Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BC, re-
ported that the ancient Persians used a version of
Sloan’s techniques to prevent groupthink. Whenever
a group reached a decision while sober, they later
reconsidered it while intoxicated.

Groupthink can also happen when a fixed-mind-
set leader punishes dissent. People may not stop
thinking critically, but they stop speaking up. Iaco-
cca tried to silence (or get rid of) people who were
critical of his ideas and decisions. He said the new,
rounder cars looked like flying potatoes, and that
was the end of it. No one was allowed to differ, as
Chrysler and its square cars lost more and more of
the market share.

David Packard, on the other hand, gave an em-
ployee a medal for defying him. The co-founder
of Hewlett-Packard tells this story. Years ago at a
Hewlett-Packard lab, they told a young engineer to
give up work on a display monitor he was devel-
oping. In response, he went “on vacation,” touring
California and dropping in on potential customers
to show them the monitor and gauge their interest.
The customers loved it, he continued working on
it, and then he somehow persuaded his manager to

put it into production. The company sold more than
seventeen thousand of his monitors and reaped a
sales revenue of thirty-five million dollars. Later, at a
meeting of Hewlett-Packard engineers, Packard gave
the young mana medal “for extraordinary contempt
and defiance beyond the normal call of engineering
duty.”

There are so many ways the fixed mindset creates
groupthink. Leaders are seen as gods who never
err. A group invests itself with special talents and
powers. Leaders, to bolster their ego, suppress dis-
sent. Or workers, seeking validation from leaders,
fall into line behind them. That’s why it’s critical to
be in a growth mindset when important decisions
are made. As Robert Wood showed in his study, a
growth mindset—by relieving people of the illusions
or the burdens of fixed ability—leads to a full and
open discussion of the information and to enhanced
decision making.

radio without hearing about the problem of praise in
the workplace. We could have seen it coming.

We've talked about all the well-meaning parents
who've tried to boost their children’s self-esteem
by telling them how smart and talented they are.
And we've talked about all the negative effects of
this kind of praise. Well, these children of praise
have now entered the workforce, and sure enough,
many can’t function without getting a sticker for
their every move. Instead of yearly bonuses, some
companies are giving quarterly or even monthly
bonuses. Instead of employee of the month, it’s the
employee of the day. Companies are calling in con-
sultants to teach them how best to lavish rewards on
this overpraised generation. We now have a work-
force full of people who need constant reassurance
and can't take criticism. Not a recipe for success in
business, where taking on challenges, showing per-
sistence, and admitting and correcting mistakes are
essential.

Why are businesses perpetuating the problem?
Why are they continuing the same misguided prac-
tices of the overpraising parents, and paying money
to consultants to show them how to do it? Maybe

we need to step back from this problem and take an-
other perspective.

If the wrong kinds of praise lead kids down
the path of entitlement, dependence, and fragility,
maybe the right kinds of praise can lead them down
the path of hard work and greater hardiness. We
have shown in our research that with the right kinds
of feedback even adults can be motivated to choose
challenging tasks and confront their mistakes.

What would this feedback look or sound like in
the workplace? Instead of just giving employees an
award for the smartest idea or praise for a brilliant
performance, they would get praise for taking ini-
tiative, for seeing a difficult task through, for strug-
gling and learning something new, for being un-
daunted by a setback, or for being open to and acting
oncriticism. Maybe it could be praise for not needing
constant praise!

Through a skewed sense of how to love their chil-
dren, many parents in the ’90s (and, unfortunately,
many parents of the ’00s) abdicated their responsi-
bility. Although corporations are not usually in the
business of picking up where parents left off, they
may need to this time. If businesses don’t play a role

in developing a more mature and growth-minded
workforce, where will the leaders of the future come
from?

ARE NEGOTIATORS BORN OR MADE?

One of the key things that the successful business-
person must be good at is negotiation. In fact, it’s
hard to imagine how a business could thrive with-
out skilled negotiators at the helm. Laura Kray and
Michael Haselhuhn have shown that mindsets have
an important impact on negotiation success. In one
study, they taught people either a fixed or a growth
mindset about negotiation skills. Half of the partici-
pants read an article called “Negotiation Ability, Like
Plaster, Is Pretty Stable Over Time.” The other half
read one called “Negotiation Ability Is Changeable
and Can Be Developed.” To give you a flavor for the
articles, the growth mindset article started by say-
ing, “While it used to be believed that negotiating
was a fixed skill that people were either born with or
not, experts in the field now believe that negotiating
is a dynamic skill that can be cultivated and devel-
oped over a lifetime.”

\reste 22 min dans le chapive 48%

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

The participants were then asked to select the kind
of negotiation task they wanted. They could choose
one that showed off their negotiation skills, al-
though they would not learn anything new. Or they
could choose one in which they might make mis-
takes and get confused, but they would learn some
useful negotiation skills. Almost half (47 percent) of
the people who were taught the fixed mindset about
negotiation skills chose the task that simply showed
off their skills, but only 12 percent of those who
were taught the growth mindset cared to pursue this
show-offy task. This means that 88 percent of the
people who learned a growth mindset wanted to dig
into the task that would improve their negotiation
skills.

In their next study, Kray and Haselhuhn moni-
tored people as they engaged in negotiations. Again,
half of the people were given a fixed mindset about
negotiation skills and the other half were given a
growth mindset. The people, two at a time, engaged
in an employment negotiation. In each pair, one per-
son was the job candidate and the other was the re-
cruiter, and they negotiated on eight issues, includ-
ing salary, vacation time, and benefits. By the end

of the negotiation, those with the growth mindset
were the clear winners, doing almost twice as well
as those with the fixed mindset. The people who had
learned the growth mindset persevered through the
rough spots and stalemates to gain more favorable
outcomes.

In three final studies, the researchers looked at
MBA students enrolled in a course on negotiation.
Here they measured the mindsets the MBA students
already had, asking them how much they agreed
with fixed mindset statements (“The kind of negoti-
ator someone is is very basic and it can’t be changed
very much,” “Good negotiators are born that way”)
and growth mindset statements (“All people can
change even their most basic negotiation qualities,”
“In negotiations, experience is a great teacher”).
Similar to before, they found that the more of a
growth mindset the student had, the better he or she
did on the negotiation task.

But does a growth mindset make people good just
at getting their own way? Often negotiations require
people to understand and try to serve the other per-
son's interests as well. Ideally, at the end of a nego-
tiation, both parties feel their needs have been met.

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

Ina study with a more challenging negotiation task,
those with a growth mindset were able to get beyond
initial failures by constructing a deal that addressed
both parties’ underlying interests. So, not only do
those with a growth mindset gain more lucrative
outcomes for themselves, but, more important, they
also come up with more creative solutions that con-
fer benefits all around.

Finally, a growth mindset promoted greater learn-
ing. Those MBA students who endorsed a growth
mindset on the first day of the negotiation course
earned higher final grades in the course weeks later.
This grade was based on performance on written
assignments, in class discussions, and during class
presentations, and reflected a deeper comprehen-
sion of negotiation theory and practice.

CORPORATE TRAINING: ARE
MANAGERS BORN OR MADE?

Millions of dollars and thousands of hours are spent
each year trying to teach leaders and managers
how to coach their employees and give them effect-
ive feedback. Yet much of this training is ineffect-

reste 18 min dans le chapive 49%


==================================================
Page 279
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

ive, and many leaders and managers remain poor
coaches. Is that because this can’t be trained? No,
that’s not the reason. Research sheds light on why
corporate training often fails.

Studies by Peter Heslin, Don VandeWalle, and Gary
Latham show that many managers do not believe
in personal change. These fixed-mindset managers
simply look for existing talent—they judge employ-
ees as competent or incompetent at the start and
that's that. They do relatively little developmental
coaching and when employees do improve, they may
fail to take notice, remaining stuck in their initial
impression. What’s more (like managers at Enron),
they are far less likely to seek or accept critical feed-
back from their employees. Why bother to coach
employees if they can’t change and why get feedback
from them if you can’t change?

Managers with a growth mindset think it’s nice to
have talent, but that’s just the starting point. These
managers are more committed to their employees’
development, and to their own. They give a great
deal more developmental coaching, they notice im-
provement in employees’ performance, and they
welcome critiques from their employees.

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

Most exciting, the growth mindset can be taught
to managers. Heslin and his colleagues conducted
a brief workshop based on well-established psycho-
logical principles. (By the way, with a few changes,
it could just as easily be used to promote a growth
mindset in teachers or coaches.) The workshop
starts off with a video and a scientific article about
how the brain changes with learning. As with our
“Brainology” workshop (described in chapter 8), it’s
always compelling for people to understand how
dynamic the brain is and how it changes with learn-
ing. The article goes on to talk about how change
is possible throughout life and how people can de-
velop their abilities at most tasks with coaching and
practice. Although managers, of course, want to find
the right person for a job, the exactly right person
doesn’t always come along. However, training and
experience can often draw out and develop the qual-
ities required for successful performance.

The workshop then takes managers through a ser-
ies of exercises in which a) they consider why it’s im-
portant to understand that people can develop their
abilities, b) they think of areas in which they once
had low ability but now perform well, c) they write

toa struggling protégé about how his or her abilities
can be developed, and d) they recall times they have
seen people learn to do things they never thought
these people could do. In each case, they reflect upon
why and how change takes place.

After the workshop, there was a rapid change in
how readily the participating managers detected im-
provement in employee performance, in how will-
ing they were to coach a poor performer, and in the
quantity and quality of their coaching suggestions.
What's more, these changes persisted over the six-
week period in which they were followed up.

What does this mean? First, it means that our best
bet is not simply to hire the most talented managers
we can find and turn them loose, but to look for
managers who also embody a growth mindset: a zest
for teaching and learning, an openness to giving and
receiving feedback, and an ability to confront and
surmount obstacles.

It also means we need to train leaders, managers,
and employees to believe in growth, in addition to
training them in the specifics of effective commu-
nication and mentoring. Indeed, a growth mindset

workshop might be a good first step in any major
training program.

Finally, it means creating a growth-mindset envir-
onment in which people can thrive. This involves:

+ Presenting skills as learnable

+ Conveying that the organization values
learning and perseverance, not just ready-
made genius or talent

+ Giving feedback in a way that promotes
) learning and future success

- Presenting managers as resources for
learning

Without a belief in human development, many
corporate training programs become exercises of
limited value. With a belief in development, such
programs give meaning to the term “human re-
sources” and become a means of tapping enormous
potential.

ARE LEADERS BORN OR MADE?

When Warren Bennis interviewed great leaders,
“They all agreed leaders are made, not born, and
made more by themselves than by any external
means.” Bennis concurred: “I believe...that every-
one, of whatever age and circumstance, is capable of
self-transformation.” Not that everyone will become
a leader. Sadly, most managers and even CEOs be-
come bosses, not leaders. They wield power instead
of transforming themselves, their workers, and their
organization.

Why is this? John Zenger and Joseph Folkman
point out that most people, when they first become
managers, enter a period of great learning. They get
lots of training and coaching, they are open to ideas,
and they think long and hard about how to do their
jobs. They are looking to develop. But once they've
learned the basics, they stop trying to improve. It
may seem like too much trouble, or they may not see
where improvement will take them. They are con-
tent to do their jobs rather than making themselves
into leaders.

Or, as Morgan McCall argues, many organizations
believe in natural talent and don’t look for people
with the potential to develop. Not only are these
organizations missing out on a big pool of possible
leaders, but their belief in natural talent might ac-
tually squash the very people they think are the
naturals, making them into arrogant, defensive non-
learners. The lesson is: Create an organization that
prizes the development of ability—and watch the
leaders emerge.

ORGANIZATIONAL MINDSETS,

When we talked about Lou Gerstner and Anne
Mulcahy, we saw the kind of company they wanted
to create—and did create. These were companies
that embraced the development of all employees and
not the worship of a handful of anointed “geniuses.”
This raised a question.

Clearly the leader of an organization can hold a

a whole have a mindset? Can it have a pervasive be-
lief that talent is just fixed or, instead, a pervasive
belief that talent can and should be developed in all

employees? And, if so, what impact will this have on
the organization and its employees? To find out, we
studied a group of large corporations consisting of
Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 companies.

An organization might embody a fixed mindset,
conveying that employees either “have it” or they
don’t: We called this a “culture of genius.” Or it might
embody more of a growth mindset, conveying that
people can grow and improve with effort, good strat-
egies, and good mentoring: We call this a “culture of
development.”

To determine a company’s mindset, we asked a di-
verse sample of employees at each organization how
much they agreed with statements like these: When
it comes to being successful, this company seems to be-
lieve that people have a certain amount of talent, and
they can’t really do much to change it (fixed mindset).
This company values natural intelligence and business
talent more than any other characteristics (also fixed
mindset). This company genuinely values the personal
development and growth of its employees (growth
mindset).

We then compiled the responses and they revealed
something important: There was a strong consensus

within each company about whether the company
had fixed- or growth-mindset beliefs and values.
We were now ready to examine the impact of
the company’s mindset—on employees’ trust in the
company, on their sense of empowerment and com-
mitment, and on the level of collaboration, innov-
ation, and ethical behavior that was embraced in the
organization.

What we found was fascinating. People who work
in growth-mindset organizations have far more
trust in their company and a much greater sense
of empowerment, ownership, and commitment.
For example, when employees were asked to rate
statements such as “People are trustworthy in this
organization,” those in growth-mindset companies
expressed far higher agreement. Right in line with
this, employees in growth-mindset companies also
reported that they were much more committed to
their company and more willing to go the extra mile
for it: “I feel a strong sense of ownership and com-
mitment to the future of this company.” Those who
worked in fixed-mindset companies, however, ex-
pressed greater interest in leaving their company for
another.

It’s nice that employees in growth-mindset or-
ganizations feel trusting and committed, but what
about agility and innovation? That’s something that
organizations should and do care greatly about these
days. Perhaps a company has to sacrifice some com-
fort and loyalty to be on the leading edge. Perhaps a
belief in fixed talent motivates innovation.

It doesn’t look that way.

It’s actually the employees in the growth-mindset
companies who say that their organization supports
(reasonable) risk-taking, innovation, and creativity.
For example, they agreed far more strongly with
statements like this: “This company genuinely sup-
ports risk-taking and will support me even if Ifail” and
“People are encouraged to be innovative in this com-
pany—creativity is welcomed.”

Employees in the fixed-mindset companies not
only say that their companies are less likely to sup-
port them in risk-taking and innovation, they are
also far more likely to agree that their organizations
are rife with cutthroat or unethical behavior: “In this
company there is a lot of cheating, taking shortcuts,
and cutting corners” or “In this company people
often hide information and keep secrets.” It makes

a lot of sense when you think about it. When or-
ganizations put the premium on natural talent, then
everyone wants to be the superstar, everyone wants
to shine brighter than the others, and people may be
more likely to cheat or cut corners to do so. Team-
work can take a nosedive.

So, employees in growth-mindset companies have
more positive views of their organizations, but is
that admiration reciprocated? Yes, it is. Supervisors
in growth-mindset companies had significantly
more positive views of their employees—and on di-
mensions companies should care about. Supervisors
in growth-mindset companies rated their employ-
ees as more collaborative and more committed to

learning and growing. And as more innovative. And
as having far greater management potential. These
are all things that make a company more agile and
more likely to stay in the vanguard.

I love this last finding: Supervisors in growth-
mindset companies saw their team members as
having far greater management potential than did
supervisors in fixed-mindset companies. They saw
future leaders in the making. I love the irony. The
fixed-mindset companies presumably searched for

“where's the talent?” The talent wasn’t flourishing.

Our findings tell us that it’s possible to weave a
fixed or growth mindset into the very fabric of an
organization to create a culture of genius or culture
of development. Everybody knows that the business
models of the past are no longer valid and that mod-
ern companies must constantly reinvent themselves
to stay alive. Which companies do you think have a
better chance of thriving in today’s world?

RELATIONSHIPS: MINDSETS
IN LOVE (OR NOT)

What was that about the course of true love never
running smooth? Well, the course to true love isn’t
so smooth, either. That path is often strewn with
disappointments and heartbreaks. Some people let
these experiences scar them and prevent them
from forming satisfying relationships in the future.
Others are able to heal and move on. What separates
them? To find out, we recruited more than a hun-
dred people and asked them to tell us about a terrible
rejection.

When I first got to New York I was incredibly
lonely. I didn’t know a soul and I totally felt
like I didn’t belong here. After about a year of

misery I met Jack. It’s almost an understate-
ment to say that we clicked instantly, we
felt like we had known each other forever. It
wasn't long before we were living together
and doing everything together. I thought I
would spend my whole life with him and he
said he felt the same way. Two really happy
years passed. Then one day I came home and
found a note. He said he had to leave, don’t
try to find him. He didn’t even sign it love.
I never heard from him again. Sometimes
when the phone rings I still think maybe it’s
him.

We heard a variation of that story over and over
again. People with both mindsets told stories like
this. Almost everyone, at one time or another, had
been in love and had been hurt. What differed—and
differed dramatically—was how they dealt with it.

After they told their stories, we asked them follow-
up questions: What did this mean to you? How did
you handle it? What were you hoping for?

When people had the fixed mindset, they felt
judged and labeled by the rejection. Permanently la-

beled. It was as though a verdict had been handed
down and branded on their foreheads: UNLOVABLE!
And they lashed out.

Because the fixed mindset gives them no recipe
for healing their wound, all they could do was hope
to wound the person who inflicted it. Lydia, the
woman in the story above, told us that she had last-
ing, intense feelings of bitterness: “I would get back
at him, hurt him any way I could if I got the chance.
He deserves it.”

In fact, for people with the fixed mindset, their
number one goal came through loud and clear. Re-
venge. As one man put it, “She took my worth with
her when she left. Not a day goes by I don’t think
about how to make her pay.” During the study, I
asked one of my fixed-mindset friends about her di-
vorce. I’ll never forget what she said. “If I had to
choose between me being happy and him being mis-
erable, I would definitely want him to be miserable.”

It had to be a person with the fixed mindset
who coined the phrase “Revenge is sweet”—the idea
that with revenge comes your redemption—because
people with the growth mindset have little taste for
it. The stories they told were every bit as wrenching,

but their reactions couldn't have been more differ-
ent.

For them, it was about understanding, forgiving,
and moving on. Although they were often deeply
hurt by what happened, they wanted to learn from
it: “That relationship and how it ended really taught
me the importance of communicating. I used to
think love conquers all, but now I know it needs a
lot of help.” This same man went on to say, “I also
learned something about who's right for me. I guess
every relationship teaches you more about who's
right for you.”

There is a French expression: “Tout comprendre
est tout pardonner.” To understand all is to forgive
all. Of course, this can be carried too far, but it’s
a good place to start. For people with the growth
mindset, the number one goal was forgiveness. As
one woman said: “I’m no saint, but I knew for my
own peace of mind that I had to forgive and forget.
He hurt me but I had a whole life waiting for me and
T'll be damned if I was going to live it in the past. One
day I just said, ‘Good luck to him and good luck to
me.”

Because of their growth mindset, they did not feel
permanently branded. Because of it, they tried to
learn something useful about themselves and rela-
tionships, something they could use toward having
a better experience in the future. And they knew
how to move on and embrace that future.

My cousin Cathy embodies the growth mindset.
Several years ago, after twenty-three years of mar-
riage, her husband left her. Then, to add insult to in-
jury, she was in an accident and hurt her leg. There
she sat, home alone one Saturday night, when she
said to herself, “I'll be damned if I’m going to sit
here and feel sorry for myself!” (Perhaps this phrase
should be the mantra of the growth mindset.) Out
she went to a dance (leg and all) where she met her
future husband.

The Contos family had pulled out all the stops. Ni-
cole Contos, in her exquisite wedding dress, arrived
at the church in a Rolls-Royce. The archbishop was
inside waiting to perform the ceremony, and hun-
dreds of friends and relatives from all over the world
were in attendance. Everything was perfect until the
best man went over to Nicole and told her the news.

The groom would not be coming. Can you imagine
the shock, the pain?

The family, thinking of the hundreds of guests, de-
cided to go through with the reception and dinner.
Then, rallying around Nicole, they asked her what
she wanted to do. In an act of great courage, she
changed into a little black dress, went to the party,
and danced solo to “I Will Survive.” It was not the
dance she had anticipated, but it was one that made
her an icon of gutsiness in the national press the
next day. Nicole was like the football player who ran
the wrong way. Here was an event that could have
defined and diminished her. Instead it was one that
enlarged her.

It's interesting. Nicole spoke repeatedly about the
pain and trauma of being stood up at her wedding,
but she never used the word humiliated. If she had
judged herself, felt flawed and unworthy—humili-
ated—she would have run and hidden, Instead, her
good clean pain made her able to surround herself
with the love of her friends and relatives and begin
the healing process.

What, by the way, had happened to the groom? As
it turned out, he had gone on the honeymoon, flying

‘A couple of years later, in the same wedding dress
and the same church, she married a great guy. Was
she scared? No, she says: “I knew he was going to be
there.”

When you think about how rejection wounds and
inflames people with the fixed mindset, it will come
as no surprise that kids with the fixed mindset are
the ones who react to taunting and bullying with
thoughts of violent retaliation. I'll return to this
later.

RELATIONSHIPS ARE DIFFERENT

In his study of gifted people, Benjamin Bloom in-
cluded concert pianists, sculptors, Olympic swim-
mers, tennis players, mathematicians, and research
neurologists. But not people who were gifted in
interpersonal relationships. He planned to. After all,
there are so many professions in which interper-
sonal skills play a key role—teachers, psychologists,
administrators, diplomats. But no matter how hard
Bloom tried, he couldn’t find any agreed-upon way
of measuring social ability.

Sometimes we're not even sure it’s an ability.
When we see people with outstanding interpersonal
skills, we don’t really think of them as gifted. We
think of them as cool people or charming people.
‘When we see a great marriage relationship, we don’t
say these people are brilliant relationship makers.
We say they’re fine people. Or they have chemistry.
Meaning what?

Meaning that as a society, we don’t understand
relationship skills. Yet everything is at stake in
people's relationships. Maybe that’s why Daniel Go-
leman’s Emotional Intelligence struck such a respon-
sive chord. It said: There are social-emotional skills
and I can tell you what they are.

Mindsets add another dimension. They help us
understand even more about why people often don’t
learn the skills they need or use the skills they have.
Why people throw themselves so hopefully into new
relationships, only to undermine themselves. Why
love often turns into a battlefield where the carnage
is staggering. And, most important, they help us
understand why some people are able to build last-
ing and satisfying relationships.

MINDSETS FALLING IN LOVE

So far, having a fixed mindset has meant believing
your personal traits are fixed. But in relationships,
two more things enter the picture—your partner
and the relationship itself. Now you can have a fixed
mindset about three things. You can believe that your
qualities are fixed, your partner’s qualities are fixed,
and the relationship’s qualities are fixed—that it’s in-
herently good or bad, meant-to-be or not meant-to-
be. Now all of these things are up for judgment.

The growth mindset says all of these things can be
developed. All—you, your partner, and the relation-
ship—are capable of growth and change.

In the fixed mindset, the ideal is instant, perfect,
and perpetual compatibility. Like it was meant to be.
Like riding off into the sunset. Like “they lived hap-
pily ever after.”

Many people want to feel their relationship is
special and not just some chance occurrence. This
seems okay. So what’s the problem with the fixed
mindset? There are two.

1. If You Have to Work at It, It Wasn’t Meant to Be

One problem is that people with the fixed mindset
expect everything good to happen automatically. It’s
not that the partners will work to help each other
solve their problems or gain skills. It’s that this will
magically occur through their love, sort of the way it
happened to Sleeping Beauty, whose coma was cured
by her prince's kiss, or to Cinderella, whose miser-
able life was suddenly transformed by her prince.

Charlene’s friends told her about Max, the new
musician in town. He had come to play cello with
the symphony orchestra. The next night, Charlene
and her friends went to see the orchestra's per-
formance, and when they went backstage afterward,
Max took Charlene’s hand and said, “Next time, let’s
make it longer.” She was taken with his intense,
romantic air, and he was taken with her charming
manner and exotic looks. As they went out, the in-
tensity grew. They seemed to understand each other
deeply. They enjoyed the same things—food, analyz-
ing people, travel. They both thought, Where have
you been all my life?

reste 1 heure et min dans le chapive 59%


==================================================
Page 303
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

Over time, though, Max became moody. Actually,
that’s how he was. It just didn’t show at first. When
he was in a bad mood, he wanted to be left alone.
Charlene wanted to talk about what was bothering
him, but that irritated him. “Just leave me alone,”
he would insist, more and more forcefully. Charlene,
however, would feel shut out.

Plus, his moods didn’t always happen at conveni-
ent times. Sometimes the couple was scheduled to
go out. Sometimes they had planned a special dinner
alone. Either he didn’t want to do it, or she would
endure his sullen silence throughout the evening. If
she tried to make light conversation, he would be
disappointed in her: “I thought you understood me.”

Friends, seeing how much they cared about each
other, urged them to work on this problem. But they
both felt, with great sorrow, that if the relationship
were the right one, they wouldn't have to work so
hard. If it were the right relationship, they would
just be able to understand and honor each other's
needs. So they grew apart and eventually broke up.

In the growth mindset, there may still be that ex-
citing initial combustion, but people in this mindset
don’t expect magic. They believe that a good, lasting

relationship comes from effort and from working
through inevitable differences.

But those with the fixed mindset don’t buy that.
Remember the fixed-mindset idea that if you have
ability, you shouldn’t have to work hard? This is the
same belief applied to relationships: If you're com-
patible, everything should just come naturally.

Every single relationship expert disagrees with
this.

Aaron Beck, the renowned psychiatrist, says that
one of the most destructive beliefs for a relationship
is “If we need to work at it, there’s something ser-
iously wrong with our relationship.”

Says John Gottman, a foremost relationship re-
searcher: “Every marriage demands an effort to keep
it on the right track; there is a constant tensio:
between the forces that hold you together and those
that can tear you apart.”

As with personal achievement, this belief—that
success should not need effort—robs people of the
very thing they need to make their relationship
thrive. It’s probably why so many relationships go
stale—because people believe that being in love
means never having to do anything taxing.

MIND READING

Part of the low-effort belief is the idea that couples
should be able to read each other's minds: We are like
one. My partner should know what I think, feel, and
need and I should know what my partner thinks, feels,
and needs. But this is impossible. Mind reading in-
stead of communicating inevitably backfires.

Elayne Savage, noted family psychologist, de-
scribes Tom and Lucy. After three months together,
Tom informed Lucy that there was an imbalance in
their relationship. Lucy, reading his mind, decided
Tom meant that he was less into the relationship
than she was. She felt discouraged. Should she break
off the relationship before he did? However, after a
therapy session, Lucy got up the courage to find out
what he meant. Tom, it turned out, had been using a
musical term to convey his wish to fine-tune the re-
lationship and move it to the next level.

I had met a few months before, and everything

more space.” Everything went blank. I couldn't be-
lieve what I was hearing. Was I completely mis-
taken about the relationship? Finally, I summoned
my courage. “What do you mean?” I asked. He said, “I
need you to move over so I can have more room.” I'm
glad Iasked.

AGREEING ON EVERYTHING

It’s strange to believe in mind reading. But it makes
sense when you realize that many people with a
fixed mindset believe that a couple should share all of
each other's views.

If you do, then you don’t need communication; you
can just assume your partner sees things the way
you do.

Raymond Knee and his colleagues had couples
come in and discuss their views of their relationship.
Those with the fixed mindset felt threatened and
hostile after talking about even minor discrepancies
in how they and their partner saw their relationship.
Even a minor discrepancy threatened their belief
that they shared all of each other’s views.

It’s impossible for a couple to share all of each
other’s assumptions and expectations. One may as-
sume the wife will stop working and be supported;
the other, that she will be an equal breadwinner. One
may assume they will have a house in the suburbs,
the other that they will have a bohemian love nest.

Michael and Robin had just finished college and
were about to get married. He was the bohemian-
love-nest type. He imagined that after they were
married, they'd enjoy the young, hip Greenwich Vil-
lage life together. So when he found the ideal apart-
ment, he thought she'd be delighted. When she saw
it, she went berserk. She'd been living in crummy lit-
tle apartments all her life, and here it was all over
again. Married people were supposed to live in nice
houses with new cars parked outside. They both felt
betrayed, and it didn’t get any better from there.

Couples may erroneously believe they agree on
each person’s rights and duties. Fill in the blank:

“As a husband, I have a right to MI), and my
wife has the duty to IIE”

“As a wife, I have a right to I, and my hus-
band has the duty to I.”

Few things can make partners more furious than
having their rights violated. And few things can
make a partner more furious than having the other
feel entitled to something you don’t think is coming
tothem.

John Gottman reports: “I’ve interviewed newlywed
men who told me with pride, ‘I’m not going to wash
the dishes, no way. That’s a woman's job’ Two years
later the same guys ask me, ‘Why don’t my wife and
Ihave sex anymore?’”

Now, a couple may agree on traditional roles.
That's up to them. But that’s different from assum-
ing it as an entitlement.

When Janet (a financial analyst) and Phil (a real es-
tate agent) met, he had just gotten a new apartment
and was thinking he’d like to have a housewarm-
ing party, a dinner for a bunch of his friends. When
Janet said, “Let's do it,” he was thrilled. Her emphasis
was on the “’s,” the us. Because she was the more
experienced cook and party giver, however, she did
most of the preparation, and she did it gladly. She
was delighted to see how happy he was to be hav-
ing this event. The problem started after the guests
arrived. Phil just went to the party. He acted like a

guest. Like she was supposed to continue doing all
the work. She was enraged.

The mature thing to do would have been to take
him aside to have a discussion. Instead, she decided
to teach him a lesson. She, too, went to the party.
Fortunately, entitlement and retaliation did not be-
come a pattern in their relationship. Communica-
tion did. In the future, things were discussed, not
assumed.

A no-effort relationship is a doomed relationship,
not a great relationship. It takes work to communi-
cate accurately and it takes work to expose and re-
solve conflicting hopes and beliefs. It doesn’t mean
there is no “they lived happily ever after,” but it’s
more like “they worked happily ever after.”

2. Problems Indicate Character Flaws

The second big difficulty with the fixed mindset is
the belief that problems are a sign of deep-seated
flaws. But just as there are no great achievements
without setbacks, there are no great relationships
without conflicts and problems along the way.

When people with a fixed mindset talk about their
conflicts, they assign blame. Sometimes they blame
themselves, but often they blame their partner. And
they assign blame to a trait—a character flaw.

But it doesn’t end there. When people blame
their partner's personality for the problem, they feel
anger and disgust toward them.

And it barrels on: Since the problem comes from
fixed traits, it can’t be solved.

So once people with the fixed mindset see flaws in
their partners, they become contemptuous of them
and dissatisfied with the whole relationship. (People
with the growth mindset, on the other hand, can
see their partners’ imperfections and still think they
have a fine relationship.)

Sometimes people with the fixed mindset blind
themselves to problems in the partner or the rela-
tionship so they won't have to go that route.

this,” he insisted. “It doesn’t mean she’s got a guy.”

Charlie's best friend urged him to look into it.
But Charlie felt that if he confronted the reality—
and it was negative—his world would come crashing
down. In the fixed mindset, he’d have to confront the
idea that either (1) the woman he loved was a bad
person, (2) he was a bad person and drove her away,
or (3) their relationship was bad and irreparable.

He couldn’t handle any of those. It didn’t occur to
him that there were problems that could be solved,
that she was sending him a message she desperately
wanted him to hear: Don’t take me for granted. I need
more attention.

A growth mindset doesn’t mean he would neces-
sarily confront her, but he would confront it—the
situation. He'd think about what was wrong. Maybe
explore the issue with a counselor. Make an in-
formed decision about what to do next. If there were
problems to be solved, at least there’d be a chance.

EACH ONE A LOSER

Penelope's friends sat at home complaining that
there were no good men. Penelope went out and
found them. Each time, she would find a great guy
and fall head over heels. “He’s the one,” she'd tell
her friends as she began reading the bridal maga-
zines and practically writing the announcement for
the local paper. They'd believe her because he was al-
ways a guy with a lot going for him.

But then something would happen. It was over for
‘one of them when he got her a tacky birthday pre-
sent. Another put ketchup on his food and some-
times wore white shoes. Another had bad electronic
habits: His cell phone etiquette was poor and he
watched too much TV. And this is only a partial list.

Assuming traits were fixed, Penelope would decide
that she couldn't live with these flaws. But most of
these were not deep or serious character problems
that couldn't be addressed with a little communica-
tion.

My husband and I had been together almost a year
and, as my birthday approached, I sent a clear mes-
sage: “I’m not mercenary, but I like a good present.”
He said, “Isn't it the thought that counts?” I replied,
“That's what people say when they don’t want to put
thought into it.

“Once a year,” I continued, “we each have our day. I
love you and I plan to put time and effort into choos-
ing a present for you. I would like you to do that for
me, too.” He’s never let me down.

Penelope assumed that somewhere out there was
someone who was already perfect. Relationship ex-
pert Daniel Wile says that choosing a partner is
choosing a set of problems. There are no problem-
free candidates. The trick is to acknowledge each
other’s limitations, and build from there.

THE FLAWS FLY

Brenda and Jack were clients of Daniel Wile, and he
tells this tale. Brenda came home from work and told
Jack a long, detailed story with no apparent point.
Jack was bored to tears but tried to hide it to be
polite. Brenda, however, could sense his true feel-

ings, so, hoping to be more amusing, she launched
into another endless story, also about a project at
work. Jack was ready to burst. They were both men-
tally hurling traits right and left. According to Wile,
they were both thinking: Brenda is boring, Jack is
selfish, and our relationship is no good.

In fact, both meant well. Brenda was afraid to say
outright that she did some great work at the office
that day. She didn’t want to be boastful. So instead
she talked about the tiny details of her project. Jack
didn’t want to be impolite, so instead of asking
Brenda questions or expressing his puzzlement, he
steeled himself and waited for her story to end.

Jack just needed to say, “You know, honey, when
you get into so many details, lose your point and get
frustrated. Why don’t you tell me why you're excited
about this project? I'd really love to hear that.”

It was a problem of communication, not a problem
of personality or character. Yet in the fixed mindset,
the blame came fast and furious.

By the way, I love these stories. When I was a kid,
Ladies’ Home Journal used to have a feature in each
issue called “Can This Marriage Be Saved?” Usually,
the answer was yes. I ate up those stories, fascinated

by all the ways a marriage could go wrong and even
more fascinated by how it could be repaired.

The story of Ted and Karen, told by Aaron Beck, isa
story of how two people with the fixed mindset went
from all good traits to all bad ones in each other's
eyes.

When Ted and Karen met, they were opposites at-
tracting. Karen radiated spontaneity and lightness.
Ted, a serious guy with the weight of the world on
his shoulders, felt that her carefree presence trans-
formed his life. “Everything she says and does is
charming,” he effused. In turn, Ted represented the
rock-like “father figure” she had never had. He was
just the kind of stable, reliable guy who could give
her a sense of security.

But a few short years later, Ted saw Karen as an
irresponsible airhead. “She never takes anything ser-
iously...I can’t depend on her.” And Karen saw Ted as
ajudgmental tyrant, dissecting her every move.

In the end, this marriage was saved—only because
the couple learned to respond to each other not
with angry labels, but with helpful actions. One day,
when Karen was swamped with work, Ted came
home to a messy house. He was angry and wanted

to scold her, but, drawing on what he'd learned from
Beck, he instead said to himself, “What is the mature
thing to do?” He answered his own question by start-
ing to clean things up. He was offering Karen sup-
port rather than judgment.

CAN THIS MARRIAGE BE SAVED?

Aaron Beck tells couples in counseling never to think
these fixed-mindset thoughts: My partner is incap-
able of change. Nothing can improve our relationship.
These ideas, he says, are almost always wrong.

Sometimes it’s hard not to think those thoughts—
as in the case of Bill and Hillary Clinton. When he
was president, Clinton lied to the nation and to his
wife about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Hillary defended him: “My husband may have his
faults, but he has never lied to me.”

The truth came out, as it has a way of doing, espe-
cially when helped by a special prosecutor. Hillary,
betrayed and furious, now had to decide whether Bill
was a permanently bad and untrustworthy husband
or aman who needed a lot of help.

This is a good time to bring up an important
point: The belief that partners have the potential for
change should not be confused with the belief that
the partner will change. The partner has to want to
change, commit to change, and take concrete actions
toward change.

The Clintons went into counseling, spending one
full day a week for a year in the process. Through
counseling, Bill came to understand how, as the
child of alcoholic parents, he had learned to lead a
dual life. On the one hand, he'd learned to shoul-
der excessive responsibility at an early age—for ex-
ample, as a boy sternly forbidding his stepfather to
strike his mother. On the other hand, he had another
part of his life where he took little responsibility,
where he made believe everything was okay no mat-
ter what was going on. That’s how he could appear
on TV and earnestly vow that he was not involved
with Lewinsky. He was in that no-responsibility and
high-denial space.

People were urging Hillary to forgive him. One
evening, Stevie Wonder called the White House to
ask if he could come over. He had written a song for

her on the power of forgiveness, and he played it to
her that night.

Yet Hillary could not have forgiven a person she
saw as a liar and a cheat. She could only forgive a
man she thought was earnestly struggling with his
problems and trying to grow.

THE PARTNER AS ENEMY

With the fixed mindset, one moment your partner is
the light of your life, the next they're your adversary.
Why would people want to transform the loved one
into an enemy?

When you fail at other tasks, it’s hard to keep blam-
ing someone else. But when something goes wrong
ina relationship, it’s easy to blame someone else. In
fact, in the fixed mindset you have a limited set of
choices. One is to blame your own permanent qual-
ities. And one is to blame your partner's. You can see
how tempting it is to foist the blame onto the other
guy.

As a legacy of my fixed mindset, I still have an
irresistible urge to defend myself and assign blame

when something in a relationship goes wrong. “It’s
not my fault!” To deal with this bad habit, my hus-
band and I invented a third party, an imaginary man
named Maurice. Whenever I start in on who's to
blame, we invoke poor Maurice and pin it on him.

Remember how hard it is for people with the
fixed mindset to forgive? Part of it is that they feel
branded by a rejection or breakup. But another part
is that if they forgive the partner, if they see him or
her as a decent person, then they have to shoulder
more of the blame themselves: If my partner’s a good
guy, then I must be a bad guy. I must be the person
who was at fault.

The same thing can happen with parents. If you
have a troubled relationship with a parent, whose
fault is it? If your parents didn’t love you enough,
were they bad parents or were you unlovable? These
are the ugly questions that haunt us within a fixed
mindset. Is there a way out?

Thad this very dilemma. My mother didn’t love me.
Most of my life 'd coped with this by blaming her
and feeling bitter. But I was no longer satisfied just
protecting myself. I longed for a loving relationship
with my mother. Yet the last thing I wanted to be

was one of those kids who begged for approval from
a withholding parent. Then I realized something. I
controlled half of the relationship, my half. I could
have my half of the relationship. At least I could be
the loving daughter I wanted to be. In a sense, it
didn’t matter what she did. I would still be ahead of
where I was.

How did it turn out? I experienced a tremendous
sense of growth letting go of my bitterness and step-
ping forward to have the relationship. The rest is
not really relevant since I wasn’t seeking validation,
but I'll tell you anyway. Something unexpected hap-
pened. Three years later, my mother said to me:
“If anyone had told me I didn’t love my children, I
would have been insulted. But now I realize it was
true. Whether it was because my parents didn’t love
us or because I was too involved in myself or because
I didn’t know what love was, I don’t know. But now I
know what itis.”

From that time until her death twenty-five years
later, we became closer and closer. As lively as each
of us was, we came even more to life in each other's
presence. Once, a few years ago, after she'd had a
stroke, the doctors warned me she couldn’t speak

and might never speak again. I walked into her
room, she looked at me and said, “Carol, I love your
outfit.”

What allowed me to take that first step, to choose
growth and risk rejection? In the fixed mindset,
I had needed my blame and bitterness. It made
me feel more righteous, powerful, and whole than
thinking I was at fault. The growth mindset allowed
me to give up the blame and move on. The growth
mindset gave me a mother.

I remember when we were kids and did something
dumb, like drop our ice-cream cone on our foot, we'd
turn to our friend and say, “Look what you made me
do.” Blame may make you feel less foolish, but you
still have a shoe full of ice cream—and a friend who's
on the defensive. Ina relationship, the growth mind-
set lets you rise above blame, understand the prob-
lem, and try to fix it—together.

Susan had a boyfriend who worried that she would
be the center of attention and he would be the taga-
long. If she were someone, he would be no one. But
Martin was far from no one. He was very successful,
even revered, in his field. He was handsome and well
liked, too. So at first Susan pooh-poohed the whole
thing. Then they attended a conference together.
They'd arrived separately and, in checking in, Susan
had chatted with the friendly hotel staff in the lobby.
That evening when the couple walked through the
lobby, the whole staff greeted her warmly. Martin
grunted. Next, they took a taxi to dinner. Toward the
end of the ride, the driver started singing her praises:
“You better hold on to her. Yes, sir, she’s a good
one.” Martin winced. The whole weekend continued
in this vein, and by the time they got home from the
conference their relationship was very strained.

Martin wasn't actively competitive. He didn’t try to
outdo Susan, he just lamented her seemingly greater
popularity. But some partners throw their hats right
into the ring.

Cynthia, a scientist, was amazing at almost every-

she married a musician who was a great cook, and in

ences. In a good relationship, people develop these
skills and, as they do, both partners grow and the
relationship deepens. But for this to happen, people
need to feel they’re on the same side.

Laura was lucky. She could be self-centered and
defensive. She could yell and pout. But James never

Not long ago, I was talking to a friend about the
view some people hold of childrearing—that parents
make little difference. In explaining that view, she
likened it to a marriage relationship: “It’s like part-
ners in a marriage. Each comes to the relationship
fully formed, and you don't expect to influence who
the partneris.”

“Oh no,” I replied. “To me the whole point of mar-
riage is to encourage your partner’s development
and have them encourage yours.”

By that I didn’t mean a My Fair Lady kind of thing
where you attempt an extreme makeover on part-
ners, who then feel they aren't good enough as they
are. I mean helping partners, within the relation-
ship, to reach their own goals and fulfill their own
potential. This is the growth mindset in action.

FRIENDSHIP

Friendships, like partnerships, are places where we
have a chance to enhance each other’s development,
and to validate each other. Both are important.
Friends can give each other the wisdom and courage

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

to make growth-enhancing decisions, and friends
can reassure each other of their fine qualities. Des-
pite the dangers of praising traits, there are times
when we need reassurance about ourselves: “Tell
me I’m not a bad person for breaking up with my
boyfriend.” “Tell me I’m not stupid even though I
bombed on the exam.”

In fact, these occasions give us a chance to pro-
vide support and give a growth message: “You gave
that relationship everything you had for three years
and he made no effort to improve things. I think
you're right to move on.” Or “What happened on
that exam? Do you understand the material? Did you
study enough? Do you think you need a tutor? Let’s
talk about it.”

But as in all relationships, people’s need to prove
themselves can tilt the balance in the wrong dir-
ection. Sheri Levy did a study that was not about
friendship, but makes an important and relevant
point.

Levy measured adolescent boys’ self-esteem and
then asked them how much they believed in nega-
tive stereotypes about girls. For example, how much
did they believe that girls were worse in math or that

girls were less rational than boys? She then meas-
ured their self-esteem again.

Boys who believed in the fixed mindset showed a
boost in self-esteem when they endorsed the stereo-
types. Thinking that girls were dumber and more
scatterbrained made them feel better about them-
selves. (Boys with the growth mindset were less
likely to agree with the stereotypes, but even when
they did, it did not give them an ego boost.)

This mentality can intrude on friendships. The
lower you are, the better I feel is the idea.

One day I was talking to a dear, wise friend. I was
puzzled about why she put up with the behavior of
some of her friends. Actually, I was puzzled about
why she even had these friends. One often acted irre-
sponsibly; another flirted shamelessly with her hus-
band. Her answer was that everyone has virtues and
foibles, and that, really, if you looked only for perfect
people, your social circle would be impoverished.
There was, however, one thing she would not put up
with: people who made her feel bad about herself.

We all know these people. They can be brilliant,
charming, and fun, but after being with them, you
feel diminished. You may ask: “Am I just doing a

number on myself?” But it is often them, trying to
build themselves up by establishing their superior-
ity and your inferiority. It could be by actively put-
ting you down, or it could be by the careless way
they treat you. Either way, you are a vehicle for (and
acasualty of) confirming their worth.

I was at a friend’s fiftieth-birthday party and her
sister gave a speech, supposedly in her honor. Her
sister talked about my friend’s insatiable sexual ap-
petite and how lucky it was she found a younger
man to marry who could handle it. “All in good
fun,” she took care of my friend’s looks, brains, and
mothering skills. After this tribute, I suddenly re-
called the saying “With friends like this, you don’t
need enemies.”

It’s difficult to realize when friends don’t wish
you well. One night I had the most vivid dream.
Someone, someone I knew well, came into my house
and one by one took all my prized possessions. In
the dream I could see what was happening, but I
couldn't see who it was. At one point, I asked the in-
truder: “Couldn't you please leave that one, it means
a lot to me.” But the person just kept taking every-
thing of value. The next morning I realized who it

was and what it meant. For the past year a close
friend had been calling upon me constantly to help
him with his work. I obliged. He was under a great
deal of stress, and I was at first happy to use what-
ever skills I had for his benefit. But it was endless, it
was not reciprocal, and on top of that he punished
me for it: “Don’t think you could ever do work this
good. Youcan help me polish my work, but you could
never be this creative.” He needed to reduce me so
he wouldn't feel one down. My dream told me it was
time to draw the line.

I'm afraid that in the fixed mindset, I was also a
culprit. I don't think I put people down, but when
you need validation, you use people for it. One time,
when Iwasa graduate student, I was taking the train
to New York and sat next to a very nice businessman.
In my opinion, we chatted back and forth pleasantly
through the hour-and-a-half journey, but at the end
he said to me, “Thank you for telling me about your-
self.” It really hit me. He was the dream validator—
handsome, intelligent, successful. And that’s what I
had used him for. I had shown no interest in him as
a person, only in him as a mirror of my excellence.

Luckily for me, what he mirrored back was a far
more valuable lesson.

Conventional wisdom says that you know who
your friends are in your times of need. And of course
this view has merit. Who will stand by you day after
day when you're in trouble? However, sometimes an
even tougher question is: Who can you turn to when
good things happen? When you find a wonderful
partner. When you get a great job offer or promo-
tion. When your child does well. Who would be glad
to hear it?

Your failures and misfortunes don’t threaten other
people's self-esteem. Ego-wise, it’s easy to be sympa-
thetic to someone in need. It’s your assets and your
successes that are problems for people who derive
their self-esteem from being superior.

SHYNESS

In some ways, shyness is the flip side of what we've
been talking about. We've been examining people
who use others to buoy themselves up. Shy people
worry that others will bring them down. They often

lreste25 mindans le chapive 58%


==================================================
Page 331
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

worry about being judged or embarrassed in social
situations.

People’s shyness can hold them back from making
friends and developing relationships. When they're
with new people, shy people report that they feel
anxious, their hearts race, they blush, they avoid eye
contact, and they may try to end the interaction as
soon as possible. Underneath it all, shy people may
be wonderful and interesting, but they often can’t
show it with someone new. And they know it.

What can mindsets teach us about shyness? Jenni-
fer Beer studied hundreds of people to find out. She
measured people's mindsets, she assessed their shy-
ness, and then she brought them together two at a
time to get acquainted. The whole thing was filmed,
and, later on, trained raters watched the film and
evaluated the interactions.

Beer found, first, that people with the fixed mind-
set were more likely to be shy. This makes sense.
The fixed mindset makes you concerned about judg-
ment, and this can make you more self-conscious
and anxious. But there were plenty of shy people
with both mindsets, and when she looked at them

\reste 23 mindans le chapive 58%

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

more closely, she found something even more inter-
esting.

Shyness harmed the social interactions of people with
the fixed mindset but did not harm the social relations
of people with the growth mindset. The observers’ rat-
ings showed that, although both fixed- and growth-
minded shy people looked very nervous for the first
five minutes of the interaction, after that the shy
growth-minded people showed greater social skills,
were more likable, and created a more enjoyable
interaction. In fact, they began to look just like non-
shy people.

This happened for good reasons. For one thing,
the shy growth-minded people looked on social situ-
ations as challenges. Even though they felt anxious,
they actively welcomed the chance to meet some-
one new. The shy fixed people, instead, wanted to
avoid meeting someone who might be more socially
skilled than they were. They said they were more
worried about making mistakes. So the fixed- and
growth-mindset people confronted the situation
with different attitudes. One embraced the chal-
lenge and the other feared the risk.

\reste 22 min dans le chapive 58%


==================================================
Page 333
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

Armed with these different attitudes, the shy
growth-mindset people felt less shy and nervous as
the interaction wore on, but the shy fixed-mindset
people continued to be nervous and continued to do
more socially awkward things, like avoiding eye con-
tact or trying to avoid talking.

You can see how these different patterns would
affect making friends. The shy growth-mindset
people take control of their shyness. They go out
and meet new people, and, after their nerves set-
tle down, their relationships proceed normally. The
shyness doesn’t tyrannize them.

But for fixed-mindset people, the shyness takes
control. It keeps them out of social situations with
new people, and when they’re in them, they can’t let
down their guard and let go of their fears.

Scott Wetzler, a therapist and professor of psych-
iatry, paints a portrait of his client George, a picture
of the shy fixed-mindset person. George was incred-
ibly shy, especially with women. He was so eager
to look cool, witty, and confident—and so worried
that he'd look overeager and inept—that he froze
and acted cold. When his attractive co-worker Jean
started flirting with him, he became so flustered

that he began avoiding her. Then one day she ap-
proached him in a nearby coffee shop and cutely
suggested he ask her to join him. When he couldn’t
think of a clever response to impress her, he replied,
“It doesn’t matter to me if you sit down or not.”

George, what were you doing? He was trying to
protect himself from rejection—by trying not to
seem too interested. And he was trying to end this
awkward situation. In a strange way, he succeeded.
He certainly didn’t seem too interested, and the
interaction soon ended, as Jean got out of there real
fast. He was just like the people in Jennifer Beer's
study, controlled by his fear of social judgment and
prevented from making contact.

Wetzler slowly helped George get over his exclusive
focus on being judged. Jean, he came to see, was
not out to judge and humiliate him, but was trying
to get to know him. With the focus switched from
being judged to developing a relationship, George
was eventually able to reciprocate. Despite his anx-
iety, he approached Jean, apologized for his rude be-
havior, and asked her to lunch. She accepted. What's
more, she was not nearly as critical as he feared.

relationships that people experience terrible rejec-

grade school, some kids are victimized. They are
ridiculed, tormented, and beaten up, not for any-
thing they’ve done wrong. It could be for their more
timid personality, how they look, what their back-
ground is, or how smart they are (sometimes they're
not smart enough; sometimes they’re too smart). It
can be a daily occurrence that makes life a night-
mare and ushers in years of depression and rage.

To make matters worse, schools often do nothing
about it. This is because it’s often done out of sight of
teachers or because it’s done by the school's favorite
students, such as the jocks. In this case, it may be the
victims, not the bullies, who are considered to be the
problem kids or the misfits.

As a society, we've paid little attention until re-
cently. Then came the school shootings. At Colum-
bine, the most notorious one, both boys had been

mercilessly bullied for years. A fellow bullying vic-
tim describes what they endured in their high
school.

In the hallways, the jocks would push kids into
lockers and call them demeaning names while
everyone laughed at the show. At lunch the jocks
would knock their victims’ food trays onto the floor,
trip them, or pelt them with food. While the victims
were eating, they would be pushed down onto the
table from behind. Then in the locker rooms before
gym class, the bullies would beat the kids up because
the teachers weren't around.

Who Are the Bullies?

Bullying is about judging. It’s about establishing
who is more worthy or important. The more power-
ful kids judge the less powerful kids. They judge
them to be less valuable human beings, and they
rub their faces in it on a daily basis. And it’s clear
what the bullies get out of it. Like the boys in Sheri
Levy’s study, they get a boost in self-esteem. It’s not
that bullies are low in self-esteem, but judging and
demeaning others can give them a self-esteem rush.

Bullies also gain social status from their actions.
Others may look up to them and judge them to be
cool, powerful, or funny. Or may fear them. Either
way, they’ve upped their standing.

There’s a big dose of fixed-mindset thinking in the
bullies: Some people are superior and some are infer-
ior. And the bullies are the judges. Eric Harris, one of
the Columbine shooters, was their perfect target. He
had a chest deformity, he was short, he was a com-
puter geek, and he was an outsider, not from Color-
ado. They judged him mercilessly.

Victims and Revenge

The fixed mindset may also play a role in how the
victim reacts to bullying. When people feel deeply
judged by a rejection, their impulse is to feel bad
about themselves and to lash out in bitterness. They
have been cruelly reduced and they wish to reduce
in return. In our studies, we have seen perfectly nor-
mal people—children and adults—respond to rejec-
tion with violent fantasies of revenge.

Highly educated, well-functioning adults, after
telling us about a serious rejection or betrayal, say

and mean “I wanted him dead” or “I could easily
have strangled her.”

When we hear about acts of school violence, we
usually think it’s only bad kids from bad homes who
could ever take matters into their own hands. But it’s
startling how quickly average, everyday kids with a
fixed mindset think about violent revenge.

We gave eighth-grade students in one of our fa-
vorite schools a scenario about bullying to read. We
asked them to imagine it was happening to them.

It is a new school year and things seem
to be going pretty well. Suddenly some
popular kids start teasing you and calling
you names. At first you brush it off—these
things happen. But it continues. Every day
they follow you, they taunt you, they make
fun of what you're wearing, they make fun
of what you look like, they tell you you’re a
loser—in front of everybody. Every day.

We then asked them to write about what they
would think and what they would do or want to do.

First, the students with the fixed mindset took the
incident more personally. They said, “I would think I
was a nobody and that nobody likes me.” Or “I would
think I was stupid and weird and a misfit.”

Then they wanted violent revenge, saying that
they'd explode with rage at them, punch their faces
in, or run them over. They strongly agreed with the
statement: “My number one goal would be to get
revenge.”

They had been judged and they wanted to judge
back. That's what Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold,
the Columbine shooters, did. They judged back. For
a few long, terrible hours, they decided who would
live and who would die.

In our study, the students with the growth mind-
set were not as prone to see the bullying as a re-
flection of who they were. Instead, they saw it as a
psychological problem of the bullies, a way for the
bullies to gain status or charge their self-esteem: “I'd
think that the reason he is bothering me is probably
that he has problems at home or at school with his
grades.” Or “They need to get a life—not just feel
good if they make me feel bad.”

Their plan was often designed to educate the bul-
lies: “I would really actually talk to them. I would
ask them questions (why are they saying all of these
things and why are they doing all of this to me).” Or
“Confront the person and discuss the issue; I would
feel like trying to help them see they are not funny.”

The students with the growth mindset also
strongly agreed that: “I would want to forgive them
eventually” and “My number one goal would be to
help them become better people.”

Whether they'd succeed in personally reforming
or educating determined bullies is doubtful. How-
ever, these are certainly more constructive first steps
than running them over.

Brooks Brown, a classmate of Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold, was bullied from third grade on. He suffered
tremendously, yet he didn’t look for revenge. He re-
jected the fixed mindset and the right of people to
judge others, as in “I am a football player, and there-
fore I’m better than you.” Or “I am a basketball
player...pathetic geeks like you are not on my level.”

More than that, he actively embraced a growth
mindset. In his own words, “People do have the po-
tential to change.” Even maybe Eric Harris, the more

depressed, hostile leader of the shootings. Brown
had had a very serious run-in with Eric Harris sev-
eral years before, but in their senior year of high
school, Brown offered a truce. “I told him that I had
changed a lot since that year...and that I hoped he
felt the same way about himself.” Brooks went on
to say that if he found that Eric hadn’t changed, he
could always pull back. “However, if he had grown
up, then why not give him the chance to prove it.”

Brooks hasn't given up. He still wants to change
people. He wants to wake up the world to the prob-
lem of bullying, and he wants to reach victims and
turn them off their violent fantasies. So he’s worked
for the filmmaker Michael Moore on Bowling for Col-
umbine and he’s set up an innovative website where
bullied kids can communicate with each other and
learn that the answer isn’t to kill. “It’s to use your
mind and make things better.”

Brooks, like me, does not see the shooters as people
who are a world apart from everyone else. His friend
Dylan Klebold, he says, was once a regular kid from
a fine home with loving, involved parents. In fact,
he warns, “We can just sit back and call the shooters
‘sick monsters, completely different from us.’...Or we

can accept that there are more Erics and Dylans out
there, who are slowly being driven...down the same
path.”

Even if a victim doesn’t have a fixed mindset to
begin with, prolonged bullying can instill it. Espe-
cially if others stand by and do nothing, or even
join in. Victims say that when they’re taunted and
demeaned and no one comes to their defense, they
start to believe they deserve it. They start to judge
themselves and to think that they are inferior.

Bullies judge. Victims take it in. Sometimes it re-
mains inside and can lead to depression and suicide.
Sometimes it explodes into violence.

What Can Be Done?

Individual children can’t usually stop the bullies,
especially when the bullies attract a group of sup-
porters. But the school can—by changing the school
mindset.

School cultures often promote, or at least accept,
the fixed mindset. They accept that some kids feel
superior to others and feel entitled to pick on them.

They also consider some kids to be misfits whom
they can do little to help.

But some schools have created a dramatic re-
duction in bullying by fighting the atmosphere of
judgment and creating one of collaboration and self-
improvement. Stan Davis, a therapist, school coun-
selor, and consultant, has developed an anti-bully-
ing program that works. Building on the work of Dan
Olweus, a researcher in Norway, Davis's program
helps bullies change, supports victims, and em-
powers bystanders to come to a victims aid. Within
a few years, physical bullying in his school was down
93 percent and teasing was down 53 percent.

Darla, a third grader, was overweight, awkward,
and a “crybaby,” She was such a prime target that
half of the class bullied her, hitting her and call-
ing her names on a daily basis—and winning one
another’s approval for it. Several years later, be-
cause of Davis's program, the bullying had stopped.
Darla had learned better social skills and even had
friends. Then Darla went to middle school and, after
a year, came back to report what had happened.
Her classmates from elementary school had seen her
through. They’d helped her make friends and pro-

tected her from her new peers when they wanted to
harass her.

Davis also gets the bullies changing. In fact, some
of the kids who rushed to Darla’s support in middle
school were the same ones who had bullied her earl-
ier. What Davis does is this. First, while enforcing
consistent discipline, he doesn’t judge the bully as a
person. No criticism is directed at traits. Instead, he
makes them feel liked and welcome at school every
day.

Then he praises every step in the right direction.
But again, he does not praise the person; he praises
their effort. “I notice that you have been staying out
of fights. That tells me you are working on getting
along with people.” You can see that Davis is leading
students directly to the growth mindset. He is help-
ing them see their actions as part of an effort to im-
prove. Even if the change was not intentional on the
part of the bullies, they may now try to make it so.

Stan Davis has incorporated our work on praise,
criticism, and mindsets into his program, and it has
worked. This is a letter I got from him.

The notion that some people are entitled to bru-
talize others is not a healthy one. Stan Davis points
out that as a society, we rejected the idea that people
were entitled to brutalize blacks and harass women.
Why do we accept the idea that people are entitled to.
brutalize our children?

By doing so, we also insult the bullies. We tell them
we don’t think they’re capable of more, and we miss
the chance to help them become more.

Grow Your Mindset

PARENTS, TEACHERS, AND COACHES:
WHERE DO MINDSETS COME FROM?

No parent thinks, “I wonder what I can do today to
undermine my children, subvert their effort, turn
them off learning, and limit their achievement.”
Of course not. They think, “I would do anything,
give anything, to make my children successful.” Yet
many of the things they do boomerang. Their help-
ful judgments, their lessons, their motivating tech-
niques often send the wrong message.

In fact, every word and action can send a message.
It tells children—or students, or athletes—how to
think about themselves. It can be a fixed-mindset
message that says: You have permanent traits and I’m
judging them. Orit can be a growth-mindset message

that says: You are a developing person and I am com-
mitted to your development.

It’s remarkable how sensitive children are to these
messages, and how concerned they are about them.
Haim Ginott, the child-rearing sage of the 1950s
through 70s, tells this story. Bruce, age five, went
with his mother to his new kindergarten. When
they arrived, Bruce looked up at the paintings on
the wall and said, “Who made those ugly pictures?”
His mother rushed to correct him: “It’s not nice to
call pictures ugly when they are so pretty.” But his
teacher knew exactly what he meant. “In here,” she
said, “you don’t have to paint pretty pictures. You
can paint mean pictures if you feel like it.” Bruce
gave her a big smile. She had answered his real ques-
tion: What happens to a boy who doesn’t paint well?

Next, Bruce spotted a broken fire engine. He picked
it up and asked in a self-righteous tone, “Who
broke this fire engine?” Again his mother rushed in:
“What difference does it make to you who broke
it? You don’t know anyone here.” But the teacher
understood. “Toys are for playing,” she told him.
“Sometimes they get broken. It happens.” Again, his

question was answered: What happens to boys who
break toys?

Bruce waved to his mother and went off to start his
first day of kindergarten. This was not a place where
he would be judged and labeled.

You know, we never outgrow our sensitivity to
these messages. Several years ago, my husband and I
spent two weeks in Provence, in the south of France.
Everyone was wonderful to us—very kind and very
generous. But on the last day, we drove to Italy for
lunch. When we got there and found a little family
restaurant, tears started streaming down my face.
I felt so nurtured. I said to David, “You know, in
France, when they’re nice to you, you feel like you've
passed a test. But in Italy, there is no test.”

Parents and teachers who send fixed-mindset mes-
sages are like France, and parents and teachers who
send growth-mindset messages are like Italy.

Let's start with the messages parents send to their
children—but, you know, they are also messages
that teachers can send to their students or coaches
can send to their athletes.

Messages About Success

“You learned that so quickly! You're so smart!”
“Look at that drawing. Martha, is he the next Pi-

casso or what?”

“You're so brilliant, you got an A without even
studying!”

If you're like most parents, you hear these as sup-
portive, esteem-boosting messages. But listen more
closely. See if you can hear another message. It’s the
one that children hear:

If I don’t learn something quickly, I’m not smart.

I shouldn't try drawing anything hard or they’ll see
I’mno Picasso.

I'd better quit studying or they won’t think I’m bril-
liant.

How do I know this? Remember chapter 3, how I
was thinking about all the praise parents were lav-
ishing on their kids in the hope of encouraging con-
fidence and achievement? You're so smart. You're
so talented. You're such a natural athlete. And I
thought, wait a minute. Isn't it the kids with the
fixed mindset—the vulnerable kids—who are ob-
sessed with this? Wouldn't harping on intelligence
or talent make kids—all kids—even more obsessed
with it?

That’s why we set out to study this. After seven ex-
periments with hundreds of children, we had some
of the clearest findings I’ve ever seen: Praising chil-
dren's intelligence harms their motivation and it
harms their performance.

How can that be? Don’t children love to be praised?

Yes, children love praise. And they especially love
to be praised for their intelligence and talent. It
really does give them a boost, a special glow—but
only for the moment. The minute they hit a snag,
their confidence goes out the window and their mo-
tivation hits rock bottom. If success means they're
smart, then failure means they’re dumb. That’s the
fixed mindset.

math, language and science, but he has had
some very real “self-worth” problems. My
husband, who is also an intelligent person,
felt his parents never valued intellect and
he has overcompensated with our son in at-
tempting to praise him for “being smart.”
Over the past years, I have suspected this
was causing a problem, because my son,
while he easily excels in school, is reluctant
to take on more difficult work or projects

would think he’s not smart. He projects an

he can perform better than others (both in-

will not attempt such activities, because of

tendency to see performance as a reflection
of character and, if I could not accomplish
something right away, to avoid that task or
treat it with contempt.

Iknow, it feels almost impossible to resist this kind
of praise. We want our loved ones to know that we
prize them and appreciate their successes. Even I
have fallen into the trap.

solved a very difficult problem we had been puzzling
over for a while. Before I could stop myself, I blurted

searched for strategies, kept at it, tried all kinds of
solutions, and finally mastered i

“Yes,” I said, smiling sweetly, “that’s exactly what I

Parents think they can hand children permanent
confidence—like a gift—by praising their brains and
talent. It doesn’t work, and in fact has the opposite
effect. It makes children doubt themselves as soon
as anything is hard or anything goes wrong. If par-
ents want to give their children a gift, the best thing
they can do is to teach their children to love chal-
lenges, be intrigued by mistakes, enjoy effort, seek
new strategies, and keep on learning. That way, their
children don’t have to be slaves of praise. They will
have a lifelong way to build and repair their own
confidence.

SENDING MESSAGES ABOUT PROCESS AND GROWTH

So what's the alternative to praising talent or intelli-
gence? David's reassurance gives us a hint. One of my
students tells us more:

I went home this weekend to find my 12-
year-old sister ecstatic about school. I asked
what she was so excited about and she said,
“J got 102 on my social studies test!” I
heard her repeat this phrase about five more
times that weekend. At that point I decided
to apply what we learned in class to this
real-life situation. Rather than praising her
intelligence or her grade, I asked questions
that made her reflect on the effort she put
into studying and on how she has improved
from the year before. Last year, her grades
dropped lower and lower as the year pro-
gressed so I thought it was important for me
to intervene and steer her in the right direc-
tion at the beginning of this year.

Does this mean we can't praise our children enthu-
siastically when they do something great? Should
we try to restrain our admiration for their suc-
cesses? Not at all. It just means that we should
keep away from a certain kind of praise—praise that
judges their intelligence or talent. Or praise that im-

good strategies. And we can ask them about their

(This may be especially important for children
with learning disabilities. Often for them it is not
sheer effort that works but finding the right strat-
egy.)

I was excited to learn recently that Haim Ginott,
through his lifelong work with children, came to the
same conclusion. “Praise should deal, not with the
child’s personality attributes, but with his efforts
and achievements.”

Sometimes people are careful to use growth-
oriented praise with their children but then ruin it
by the way they talk about others. I have heard par-
ents say in front of their children, “He'
loser,” “She's a natural genius,” or “She's a pea-brain.”
When children hear their parents level fixed judg-
ments at others, it communicates a fixed mindset.
‘And they have to wonder, Am I next?

This caveat applies to teachers, too! In one study,
we taught students a math lesson spiced up with
some math history, namely, stories about great
mathematicians. For half of the students, we talked
about the mathematicians as geniuses who easily
came up with their math discoveries. This alone
propelled students into a fixed mindset. It sent the

message: There are some people who are born smart in
math and everything is easy for them. Then there are
the rest of you. For the other half of the students,
we talked about the mathematicians as people who
became passionate about math and ended up mak-
ing great discoveries. This brought students into
a growth mindset. The message was: Skills and
achievement come through commitment and effort. It’s
amazing how kids sniff out these messages from our
innocent remarks.

One more thing about praise. When we say to
children, “Wow, you did that so quickly!” or “Look,
you didn’t make any mistakes!” what message are
we sending? We are telling them that what we prize
are speed and perfection. Speed and perfection are
the enemy of difficult learning: “If you think I'm
smart when I’m fast and perfect, I'd better not take
on anything challenging.” So what should we say
when children complete a task—say, math problems
—quickly and perfectly? Should we deny them the
praise they have earned? Yes. When this happens, I
say, “Whoops. I guess that was too easy. I apologize
for wasting your time. Let’s do something you can
really learn from!”

REASSURING CHILDREN

How do you make a child feel secure before a test
or performance? The same principle applies. Re-
assuring children about their intelligence or talent
backfires. They'll only be more afraid to show a defi-
ciency.

Kristina was a really bright high school student
who, much to her shame, did terribly on tests. She
always studied, she always knew the material, but
every time it came to the test, she got so wound up
that her mind went blank. Her grades suffered. She
disappointed her teachers. She let her parents down.
And it was only going to get worse as she faced the
College Board tests that the schools she longed to at-
tend prized so highly.

The night before each test, her parents, seeing how
distraught she was, tried to build her confidence.
“Look, you know how smart you are and we know
how smart you are. You've got this nailed. Now, stop
worrying.”

They were as supportive as they knew how to be,
but they were raising the stakes even higher. What
could they have said instead?

“It must be a terrible thing to feel that everyone is
evaluating you and you can’t show what you know.
We want you to know that we are not evaluating
you. We care about your learning, and we know that
you've learned your stuff, We're proud that you've
stuck to it and kept learning,”

Messages About Failure

Praising success should be the least of our prob-
lems, right? Failure seems like a much more delicate
matter. Children may already feel discouraged and
vulnerable, Let’s tune in again, this time to the mes-
sages parents can send in times of failure.
Nine-year-old Elizabeth was on her way to her first
gymnastics meet. Lanky, flexible, and energetic, she
was just right for gymnastics, and she loved it. Of
course, she was a little nervous about competing,
but she was good at gymnastics and felt confident of
doing well. She had even thought about the perfect
place in her room to hang the ribbon she would win.

In the first event, the floor exercises, Elizabeth
went first. Although she did a nice job, the scoring
changed after the first few girls and she lost. Eliza-
beth also did well in the other events, but not well
enough to win. By the end of the evening, she had re-
ceived no ribbons and was devastated.

What would you do if you were Elizabeth's par-
ents?

4. Tell Elizabeth you thought she was the best.

2, Tell her she was robbed of a ribbon that was
rightfully hers.

3. Reassure her that gymnastics is not that
important.

4. Tell her she has the ability and will surely win
next time.

5. Tell her she didn't deserve to win.
There is a strong message in our society about how
to boost children’s self-esteem, and a main part of

that message is: Protect them from failure! While this

disappointment, it can be harmful in the long run.
Why?

Let’s look at the five possible reactions from a
mindset point of view—and listen to the messages:

The first (you thought she was the best) is basically
insincere. She was not the best—you know it, and
she does, too. This offers her no recipe for how to re-
cover or how to improve.

The second (she was robbed) places blame on
others, when in fact the problem was mostly with
her performance, not the judges. Do you want her to
grow up blaming others for her deficiencies?

The third (reassure her that gymnastics doesn’t
really matter) teaches her to devalue something if
she doesn’t do well in it right away. Is this really the
message you want to send?

The fourth (she has the ability) may be the most
dangerous message of all. Does ability automatically
take you where you want to go? If Elizabeth didn’t
win this meet, why should she win the next one?

The last option (tell her she didn’t deserve to win)
seems hardhearted under the circumstances. And of
course you wouldn't say it quite that way. But that’s

pretty much what her growth-minded father told
her.

Here’s what he actually said: “Elizabeth, I know
how you feel. It’s so disappointing to have your
hopes up and to perform your best but not to win.
But you know, you haven't really earned it yet. There
were many girls there who've been in gymnastics
longer than you and who've worked a lot harder
than you. If this is something you really want, then
it’s something you'll really have to work for.”

He also let Elizabeth know that if she wanted to do
gymnastics purely for fun, that was just fine. But if
she wanted to excel in the competitions, more was
required.

Elizabeth took this to heart, spending much more
time repeating and perfecting her routines, espe-
cially the ones she was weakest in. At the next meet,
there were eighty girls from all over the region.
Elizabeth won five ribbons for the individual events
and was the overall champion of the competition,
hauling home a giant trophy. By now, her room is so
covered with awards, you can hardly see the walls.

In essence, her father not only told her the truth,
but also taught her how to learn from her failures

and do what it takes to succeed in the future. He
sympathized deeply with her disappointment, but
he did not give her a phony boost that would only
lead to further disappointment.

I've met with many coaches and they ask me:
“what happened to the coachable athletes? Where
did they go?” Many of the coaches lament that
when they give their athletes corrective feedback,
the athletes grumble that their confidence is being
undermined. Sometimes the athletes phone home
and complain to their parents. They seem to want
coaches who will simply tell them how talented they
are and leave it at that.

The coaches say that in the old days after a little
league game or a kiddie soccer game, parents used to
review and analyze the game on the way home and
give helpful (process) tips. Now on the ride home,
they say, parents heap blame on the coaches and ref-
erees for the child’s poor performance or the team’s
loss. They don’t want to harm the child’s confidence
by putting the blame on the child.

But as in the example of Elizabeth above, children
need honest and constructive feedback. If children
are “protected” from it, they won't learn well. They

will experience advice, coaching, and feedback as
negative and undermining. Withholding construct-
ive criticism does not help children’s confidence; it
harms their future.

CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM: MORE
ABOUT FAILURE MESSAGES

We always hear the term constructive criticism. But
doesn’t everyone think the criticism they give their
children is constructive? Why would they give it if
they didn’t think it was helpful? Yet a lot if it is not
helpful at all. It’s full of judgment about the child.
Constructive means helping the child to fix some-
thing, build a better product, or doa better job.

acter at the same time and to imply that the defects

How could the dad have expressed his frustration

attributes? Here are some ways.

“Son, it really makes me upset when you don’t doa

“Son, is there something you didn’t understand in
the assignment? Would you like me to go over it
with you?”

“Son, I feel sad when I see you missing a chance to
learn. Can you think of a way to do this that would
help you learn more?”

“gon, this looks like a really boring assignment.
You have my sympathy. Can you think of a way to
make it more interesting?” or “Let’s try to think of a
way to lessen the pain and still do a good job. Do you
have any ideas?”

“Son, remember I told you how tedious things help
us learn to concentrate? This one is a real challenge.
This will really take all your concentration skills.

Children Learn the Messages

Kids with the fixed mindset tell us they get constant
messages of judgment from their parents. They say
they feel as though their traits are being measured
all the time.

We asked them: “Suppose your parents offer to
help you with your schoolwork. Why would they do
this?”

They said: “The real reason is that they wanted to
see how smart I was at the schoolwork I was work-
ingon.”

We asked: “Suppose your parents are happy that
you got a good grade. Why would that be?”

They said: “They were happy to see I was a smart
kid.”

We asked: “Suppose your parents discussed your
performance with you when you did poorly on
something in school. Why would they do this?”

They said: “They might have been worried I wasn’t
one of the bright kids,” and “They think bad grades
might mean I’m not smart.”

So every time something happens, these children
hear a message of judgment.

Maybe all kids think their parents are judging
them. Isn’t that what parents do—nag and judge?
That’s not what students with the growth mindset
think. They think their parents are just trying to en-
courage learning and good study habits. Here’s what
they say about their parents’ motives:

A: They wanted to make sure I learned as much as I

ance with you when you did poorly on something

Even when it was about their conduct or their
relationships, the kids with the fixed mindset felt
judged, but the kids with the growth mindset felt
helped.

you didn’t do what they asked you to do. Why
would they be this way?

All kids misbehave. Research shows that normal

Children learn these lessons early. Children as
young as toddlers pick up these messages from their
parents, learning that their mistakes are worthy of
judgment and punishment. Or learning that their

mistakes are an occasion for suggestions and teach-
ing.

Here's a kindergarten boy we will never forget. You
will hear him role-playing different messages from
his two parents. This is the situation: He wrote some
numbers in school, they contained an error, and now
he tells us how his parents would react.

MOTHER: Hello. What are you sad about?

Boy: I gave my teacher some numbers and I
skipped the number 8 and now I’m feeling sad.
MOTHER: Well, there’s one thing that can cheer you
up.

Boy: What?

MoTHER: If you really tell your teacher that you
tried your best, she wouldn't be mad at you. [Turn-
ing to father] We're not mad, are we?

FATHER: Oh, yes we are! Son, you better go right to
your room.

I wish I could tell you he listened to his mother’s
growth-oriented message. But in our study, he
seemed to heed the judgmental message of his dad,

downgrading himself for his errors and having no
good plan for fixing them. Yet at least he had his
mother’s effort message that he could, hopefully, put
to use in the future.

Parents start interpreting and reacting to their
child’s behavior at minute one. A new mother tries
to nurse her baby. The baby cries and won't nurse.
Or takes a few sucks, gives up, and starts screaming.
Is the baby stubborn? Is the baby deficient? After
all, isn’t nursing an inborn reflex? Aren’t babies sup-
posed to be “naturals” at nursing? What’s wrong
with my baby?

Anew mother in this situation told me: “At first I
got really frustrated. Then I kept your work in mind.
Ikept saying to my baby, ‘We're both learning how to
do this. [know you're hungry. I know it’s frustrating,
but we're learning’ This way of thinking helped me
stay cool and guide her through till it worked. It also
helped me understand my baby better so I knew how
to teach her other things, too.”

Don’t judge. Teach. It’s a learning process.

CHILDREN PASS ON THE MESSAGES

Another way we know that children learn these
messages is that we can see how they pass them on.
Even young children are ready to pass on the wis-
dom they’ve learned. We asked second-grade chil-
dren: “What advice would you give to a child in your
class who was having trouble in math?” Here's the
advice from a child with the growth mindset:

Do you quit a lot? Do you think for a minute
and then stop? If you do, you should think
for a long time—two minutes maybe and if
you can’t get it you should read the problem
again. If you can’t get it then, you should
raise your hand and ask the teacher.

Isn’t that the greatest? The advice from children
with the fixed mindset was not nearly as useful.
Since there's no recipe for success in the fixed mind-
set, their advice tended to be short and sweet. “I’m
sorry” was the advice of one child as he offered his
condolences.

Even babies can pass along the messages they've
received. Mary Main and Carol George studied
abused children, who had been judged and punished
by their parents for crying or making a fuss. Abusive
parents often don’t understand that children’s cry-
ing is a signal of their needs, or that babies can’t stop
crying on command. Instead, they judge the child as
disobedient, willful, or bad for crying.

Main and George watched the abused children
(who were one to three years old) in their day care
setting, observing how they reacted when other
children were in distress and crying. The abused
children often became angry at the distressed chil-
dren, and some even tried to assault them. They had
gotten the message that children who cry are to be
judged and punished.

We often think that the legacy of abuse gets passed
on to others only when the victims of abuse become
parents. But this amazing study shows that children
learn lessons early and they act on them.

How did nonabused children react to their dis-
tressed classmate, by the way? They showed sym-
pathy. Many went over to the crying child to see
what was wrong and to see if they could help out.

ISN'T DISCIPLINE TEACHING?

Many parents think that when they judge and pun-
ish, they are teaching, as in “I'll teach you a lesson
you'll never forget.” What are they teaching? They
are teaching their children that if they go against
the parents’ rules or values, they'll be judged and
punished. They’re not teaching their children how
to think through the issues and come to ethical, ma-
ture decisions on their own.

And chances are, they’re not teaching their chil-
dren that the channels of communication are open.

Sixteen-year-old Alyssa came to her mother and
said that she and her friends wanted to try alcohol.
Could she invite them over for a “cocktail party”?
On the face of it, this might seem outrageous. But
here’s what Alyssa meant. She and her friends had
been going to parties where alcohol was available,
but they didn’t want to try it in a setting where they
didn’t feel safe and in control. They also didn’t want
to drive home after drinking. They wanted to try it
in a supervised setting, with their parents’ permis-

sion, where their parents could come and pick them
up afterward.

It doesn’t matter whether Alyssa’s parents said yes
or no. They had a full discussion of the issues in-
volved. They had a far more instructive discussion
than what would have followed from an outraged,
angry, and judgmental dismissal.

It’s not that growth-minded parents indulge and
coddle their children. Not at all. They set high stand-
ards, but they teach the children how to reach them.
They say no, but it’s a fair, thoughtful, and respect-
ful no. Next time you're in a position to discipline,
ask yourself, What is the message I’m sending here: I
will judge and punish you? Or I will help you think and
learn?

MINDSETS CAN BE A LIFE-AND-DEATH MATTER

Of course parents want the best for their children,
but sometimes parents put their children in danger.
As the director of undergraduate studies for my de-
partment at Columbia, I saw a lot of students in
trouble. Here is the story of a great kid who almost
didn’t make it.

Sandy showed up in my office at Columbia one
week before graduation. She wanted to change her
major to psychology. This is basically a wacky re-
quest, but I sensed her desperation and listened
carefully to her story. When I looked over her record,
it was filled with A+’s and F’s. What was going on?

Sandy had been groomed by her parents to go to
Harvard. Because of their fixed mindset, the only
goal of Sandy’s education was to prove her worth
and competence (and perhaps theirs) by gaining ad-
mission to Harvard. Going there would mean that
she was truly intelligent. For them, it was not about
learning. It was not about pursuing her love of sci-
ence. It was not even about making a great contribu-
tion. It was about the label. But she didn’t get in. And
she fell into a depression that had plagued her ever
since. Sometimes she managed to work effectively
(the A+’s), but sometimes she did not (the F's).

I knew that if I didn’t help her she wouldn’t gradu-
ate, and if she didn’t graduate she wouldn't be able to
face her parents. And if she couldn’t face her parents,
I didn’t know what would happen.

Iwas legitimately able to help Sandy graduate, but
that isn’t really the point. It’s a real tragedy to take a

brilliant and wonderful kid like Sandy and crush her
with the weight of these labels.

Ihope these stories will teach parents to “want the
best” for their children in the right way—by foster-
ing their interests, growth, and learning.

WANTING THE BEST IN THE WORST WAY

Let’s look more closely at the message from Sandy’s
parents: We don’t care about who you are, what you're
interested in, and what you can become. We don’t care
about learning. We will love and respect you only if you
go to Harvard.

Mark’s parents felt the same way. Mark was an
exceptional math student, and as he finished jun-
ior high he was excited about going to Stuyvesant
High School, a special high school in New York with
a strong math-and-science curriculum. There, he
would study math with the best teachers and talk
math with the most advanced students in the city.
Stuyvesant also had a program that would let him
take college math courses at Columbia as soon as he
was ready.

But at the last moment, his parents would not let
him go. They had heard that it was hard to get into
Harvard from Stuyvesant, So they made him go toa
different high school.

It didn’t matter that he wouldn’t be able to pursue
his interests or develop his talents as well. Only one
thing mattered, and it starts with an H.

“WE LOVE YOU—ON OUR TERMS”

It's not just I’m judging you. It’s I’m judging you and
I'llonly love you if you succeed—on my terms.

We've studied kids ranging from six years old to
college age. Those with the fixed mindset feel their
parents won't love and respect them unless they ful-
fill their parents’ aspirations for them. The college
students say:

“| often feel like my parents won't value me if I’m
not as successful as they would like.”

Or: “My parents say I can be anything I like, but
deep down I feel they won't approve of me unless I
pursue a profession they admire.”

John McEnroe’s father was like that. He was judg-
mental—everything was black-and-white—and he
put on the pressure. “My parents pushed me....My
dad was the one mainly. He seemed to live for my
growing little junior career....I remember telling my
dad that I wasn’t enjoying it. I'd say, ‘Do you have to
come to every match? Do you have to come to this
practice? Can't you take one off?’”

McEnroe brought his father the success he craved,
but McEnroe didn’t enjoy a moment of it. He says he
enjoyed the consequences of his success—being at the
top, the adulation, and the money. However, he says,
“Many athletes seem truly to love to play their sport.
I don’t think I ever felt that way about tennis.”

Ithink he did love it at the very beginning, because
he talks about how at first he was fascinated by all
the different ways you could hit a ball and create
new shots. But we never hear about that kind of fas-
cination again. Mr. McEnroe saw his boy was good at
tennis and on went the pressure, the judgment, and
the love that depended on his son’s success.

Tiger Woods's father presents a contrast. There’s
no doubt that this guy is ambitious. He also sees his
son as a chosen person with a God-given destiny, but

he fostered Tiger’s love of golf and raised Tiger to
focus on growth and learning. “If Tiger had wanted
to be a plumber, I wouldn’t have minded, as long as
he was a hell of a plumber. The goal was for him to
be a good person. He's a great person.” Tiger says in
return, “My parents have been the biggest influence
in my life. They taught me to give of myself, my time,
talent, and, most of all, my love.” This shows that
you can have superinvolved parents who still foster
the child’s own growth, rather than replacing it with
their own pressure and judgments.

Dorothy DeLay, the famous violin teacher, encoun-
tered pressure-cooker parents all the time. Parents
who cared more about talent, image, and labels than
about the child’s long-term learning.

One set of parents brought their eight-year-old boy
to play for DeLay. Despite her warnings, they had
made him memorize the Beethoven violin concerto.
He was note-perfect, but he played like a frightened
robot. They had, in fact, ruined his playing to suit
their idea of talent, as in, “My eight-year-old can play
the Beethoven violin concerto. What can yours do?”

DeLay spent countless hours with a mother who
insisted it was time for her son to be signed by

a fancy talent agency. But had she followed De-
Lay’s advice? No. For quite a while, DeLay had been
warning her that her son didn’t have a large enough
repertoire. Rather than heeding the expert advice
and fostering her son’s development, however, the
mother refused to believe that anyone could turn
down a talent like his for such a slight reason.

In sharp contrast was Yura Lee's mother. Mrs. Lee
always sat serenely during Yura’s lesson, without the
tension and frantic note taking of some of the other
parents. She smiled, she swayed to the music, she
enjoyed herself. As a result, Yura did not develop the
anxieties and insecurities that children with over-
invested, judgmental parents do. Says Yura, “I'm al-
ways happy when I play.”

IDEALS

Isn’t it natural for parents to set goals and have
ideals for their children? Yes, but some ideals are
helpful and others are not. We asked college stu-
dents to describe their ideal of a successful student.
And we asked them to tell us how they thought they
measured up to that ideal.

Mostly not. Instead, they said these ideals disrupted
their thinking, made them procrastinate, made
them give up, and made them stressed-out. They
were demoralized by the ideal they could never hope
tobe.

Students with the growth mindset described
ideals like these:

“A successful student is one whose primary goal is
to expand their knowledge and their ways of think-
ing and investigating the world. They do not see
grades as an end in themselves but as means to con-
tinue to grow.”

Or: “The ideal student values knowledge for its
own sake, as well as for its instrumental uses. He or
she hopes to make a contribution to society at large.”

Were they similar to their ideal? They were work-
ing toward it. “As similar as I can be—hey, it takes
effort.” Or: “I believed for many years that grades/
tests were the most important thing but I am trying
to move beyond that.” Their ideals were inspiring to
them.

When parents give their children a fixed-mindset
ideal, they are asking them to fit the mold of the
brilliant, talented child, or be deemed unworthy.
There is no room for error. And there is no room for
the children’s individuality—their interests, their
quirks, their desires and values. I can hardly count
the times fixed-mindset parents have wrung their
hands and told me how their children were rebelling
or dropping out.

Haim Ginott describes Nicholas, age seventeen:

In my father’s mind there is a picture of an
ideal son. When he compares him to me,
he is deeply disappointed. I don't live up to
my father’s dream. Since early childhood, I
sensed his disappointment. He tried to hide
it, but it came out in a hundred little ways
—in his tone, in his words, in his silence. He

tried hard to make me a carbon copy of his
dreams. When he failed he gave up on me.
But he left a deep scar, a permanent feeling
of failure.

When parents help their children construct
growth-minded ideals, they are giving them some-
thing they can strive for. They are also giving their
children growing room, room to grow into full
human beings who will make their contribution to
society in a way that excites them. I have rarely
heard a growth-minded parent say, “I am disap-
pointed in my child.” Instead, with a beaming smile,
they say, “I am amazed at the incredible person my
child has become.”

Everything I’ve said about parents applies to
teachers, too. But teachers have additional concerns.
They face large classes of students with differing
skills, whose past learning they've had no part in.
What's the best way to educate these students?

TEACHERS (AND PARENTS): WHAT MAKES
A GREAT TEACHER (OR PARENT)?

Many educators think that lowering their standards
will give students success experiences, boost their
self-esteem, and raise their achievement. It comes
from the same philosophy as the overpraising of
students’ intelligence. Well, it doesn’t work. Lower-
ing standards just leads to poorly educated students
who feel entitled to easy work and lavish praise.

For thirty-five years, Sheila Schwartz taught aspir-
ing English teachers. She tried to set high standards,
especially since they were going to pass on their
knowledge to generations of children. But they be-
came indignant. “One student, whose writing was
full of grammatical mistakes and misspellings,” she
says, “marched into my office with her husband
from West Point—in a dress uniform, his chest
covered with ribbons—because her feelings had
been hurt by my insistence on correct spelling.”

Another student was asked to summarize the
theme of To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee’s novel

‘reste 1 heure et 10 min dans le chapite 68%

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

about a southern lawyer fighting prejudice and
(unsuccessfully) defending a black man accused of
murder. The student insisted the theme was that
“all people are basically nice.” When Schwartz ques-
tioned that conclusion, the student left the class
and reported her to the dean. Schwartz was reprim-
anded for having standards that were too high. Why,
Schwartz asks, should the low standards of these fu-
ture teachers be honored above the needs of the chil-
dren they will one day teach?

On the other hand, simply raising standards in
our schools, without giving students the means of
reaching them, is a recipe for disaster. It just pushes
the poorly prepared or poorly motivated students
into failure and out of school.

Is there a way to set standards high and have stu-
dents reach them?

In chapter 3, we saw in the work of Falko Rhein-
berg that teachers with the growth mindset brought
many low achievers up into the high-achieving
range. We saw in the growth-minded teaching of
Jaime Escalante that inner-city high school students
could learn college calculus, and in the growth-
minded teaching of Marva Collins that inner-city

grade school children could read Shakespeare. In
this chapter, we'll see more. We'll see how growth-
oriented teaching unleashes children’s minds.

I'll focus on three great teachers, two who worked
with students who are considered “disadvantaged”
and one who worked with students considered
supertalented. What do these great teachers have in
common?

Great Teachers

The great teachers believe in the growth of the intellect
and talent, and they are fascinated with the process of
learning.

Marva Collins taught Chicago children who had
been judged and discarded. For many, her classroom
was their last stop. One boy had been in and out of
thirteen schools in four years. One stabbed children
with pencils and had been thrown out of a mental
health center. One eight-year-old would remove the
blade from the pencil sharpener and cut up his class-
mates’ coats, hats, gloves, and scarves. One child re-
ferred to killing himself in almost every sentence.
One hit another student with a hammer on his first

day. These children hadn't learned much in school,
but everyone knew it was their own fault. Everyone
but Collins.

When 60 Minutes did a segment on Collins's class-
room, Morley Safer tried his best to get a child to say
he didn’t like the school. “It’s so hard here. There’s no
recess. There’s no gym. They work you all day. You
have only forty minutes for lunch. Why do you like
it? It’s just too hard.” But the student replied, “That's
why I like it, because it makes your brains bigger.”

Chicago Sun-Times writer Zay Smith interviewed
one of the children: “We do hard things here. They
fill your brain.”

As Collins looks back on how she got started, she
says, “I have always been fascinated with learning,
with the process of discovering something new, and
it was exciting to share in the discoveries made
by my...students.” On the first day of school, she
always promised her students—all students—that
they would learn. She forged a contract with them.

“T know most of you can’t spell your name. You
don’t know the alphabet, you don’t know how to
read, you don’t know homonyms or how to syllabi-
cate. I promise you that you will. None of you has

ever failed. School may have failed you. Well, good-
bye to failure, children. Welcome to success. You will
read hard books in here and understand what you
read. You will write every day....But you must help
me to help you. If you don’t give anything, don’t
expect anything. Success is not coming to you, you
must come to it.”

Her joy in her students’ learning was enormous.
‘As they changed from children who arrived with
“toughened faces and glassed-over eyes” to children
who were beginning to brim with enthusiasm, she
told them, “I don’t know what St. Peter has planned
for me, but you children are giving me my heaven on
earth.”

Rafe Esquith teaches Los Angeles second graders
from poor areas plagued with crime. Many live with
people who have drug, alcohol, and emotional prob-
lems. Every day he tells his students that he is no
smarter than they are—just more experienced. He
constantly makes them see how much they have
grown intellectually—how assignments that were
once hard have become easier because of their prac-
tice and discipline.

Unlike Collins’s school or Esquith’s school, the Juil-
liard School of music accepts only the most talented
students in the world. You would think the idea
would be, You’re all talented, now let’s get down to
learning. But if anything, the idea of talent and ge-
nius looms even larger there. In fact, many teachers
mentally weeded out the students they weren't
going to bother with. Except for Dorothy DeLay, the
wondrous violin teacher of Itzhak Perlman, Midori,
and Sarah Chang.

DeLay’s husband always teased her about her
“midwestern” belief that anything is possible. “Here
is the empty prairie—let’s build a city.” That’s exactly
why she loved teaching. For her, teaching was about
watching something grow before her very eyes. And
the challenge was to figure out how to make it hap-
pen. If students didn’t play in tune, it was because
they hadn’t learned how.

Her mentor and fellow teacher at Juilliard, Ivan Ga-
lamian, would say, “Oh, he has no ear. Don’t waste
your time.” But she would insist on experimenting
with different ways of changing that. (How can I do
it?) And she usually found a way. As more and more
students wanted a part of this mindset and as she

“wasted” more and more of her time on these efforts,
Galamian tried to get the president of Juilliard to fire
her.

It's interesting, Both DeLay and Galamian valued
talent, but Galamian believed that talent was inborn
and DeLay believed that it was a quality that could
be acquired. “I think it’s too easy for a teacher to say,
‘Oh this child wasn’t born with it, so I won't waste
my time? Too many teachers hide their own lack of
ability behind that statement.

DeLay gave her all to every one of her students.
Itzhak Perlman was her student and so was his wife,
Toby, who says that very few teachers get even a
fraction of an Itzhak Perlman in a lifetime. “She got
the whole thing, but I don't believe she gave him
more than she gave me...and I believe I am just one
of many, many such people.” Once DeLay was asked,
about another student, why she gave so much time
to a pupil who showed so little promise. “I think she
has something special....It’s in her person. There is
some kind of dignity.” If DeLay could get her to put
it into her playing, that student would be a special
violinist.

High Standards and a Nurturing Atmosphere

Great teachers set high standards for all their stu-
dents, not just the ones who are already achieving.
Marva Collins set extremely high standards, right
from the start. She introduced words and concepts
that were, at first, way above what her students
could grasp. Yet she established on Day One an at-
mosphere of genuine affection and concern as she
promised students they would produce: “I’m gonna
love you...I love you already, and I'm going to love
you even when you don’t love yourself,” she said to
the boy who wouldn't try.

Do teachers have to love all of their students? No,
but they have to care about every single student.

Teachers with the fixed mindset create an atmos-
phere of judging. These teachers look at students’
beginning performance and decide who's smart and
who's dumb. Then they give up on the “dumb” ones.
“They're not my responsibility.”

These teachers don’t believe in improvement, so
they don’t try to create it. Remember the fixed-
mindset teachers in chapter 3 who sai

“according to my experience students’ achieve-
ment mostly remains constant in the course of a
year.”

“Asa teacher I have no influence on students’ intel-
lectual ability.”

This is how stereotypes work. Stereotypes tell
teachers which groups are bright and which groups
are not. So teachers with the fixed mindset know
which students to give up on before they’ve even
met them.

More on High Standards and a Nurturing Atmosphere

When Benjamin Bloom studied his 120 world-
class concert pianists, sculptors, swimmers, tennis
players, mathematicians, and research neurologists,
he found something fascinating. For most of them,
their first teachers were incredibly warm and ac-
cepting. Not that they set low standards. Not at all,
but they created an atmosphere of trust, not judg-
ment. It was, “I’m going to teach you,” not “I’m going
tojudge your talent.”

As you look at what Collins and Esquith demanded
of their students—all their students—it’s almost

shocking. When Collins expanded her school to in-
clude young children, she required that every four-
year-old who started in September be reading by
Christmas. And they all were. The three- and four-
year-olds used a vocabulary book titled Vocabulary
{for the High School Student. The seven-year-olds were
reading The Wall Street Journal. For older children,
a discussion of Plato's Republic led to discussions of
de Tocqueville's Democracy in America, Orwell’s Ani-
mal Farm, Machiavelli, and the Chicago city council.
Her reading list for the late-grade-school children in-
cluded The Complete Plays of Anton Chekhov, Physics
Through Experiment, and The Canterbury Tales. Oh,
and always Shakespeare. Even the boys who picked
their teeth with switchblades, she says, loved Shake-
speare and always begged for more.

Yet Collins maintained an extremely nurturing at-
mosphere. A very strict and disciplined one, but a
loving one. Realizing that her students were com-
ing from teachers who made a career of telling
them what was wrong with them, she quickly made
known her complete commitment to them as her
students and as people.

Esquith bemoans the lowering of standards. Re-
cently, he tells us, his school celebrated reading
scores that were twenty points below the national
average. Why? Because they were a point or two
higher than the year before. “Maybe it’s important
to look for the good and be optimistic,” he says, “but
delusion is not the answer. Those who celebrate fail-
ure will not be around to help today’s students cele-
brate their jobs flipping burgers....Someone has to
tell children if they are behind, and lay out a plan of
attack to help them catch up.”

All of his fifth graders master a reading list that in-
cludes Of Mice and Men, Native Son, Bury My Heart at
Wounded Knee, The Joy Luck Club, The Diary of Anne
Frank, To Kill a Mockingbird, and A Separate Peace.
Every one of his sixth graders passes an algebra final
that would reduce most eighth and ninth graders to
tears. But again, all is achieved in an atmosphere of
affection and deep personal commitment to every
student.

“Challenge and nurture” describes DeLay’s ap-
proach, too. One of her former students expresses
it this way: “That is part of Miss DeLay’s genius—to
put people in the frame of mind where they can do

their best....Very few teachers can actually get you
to your ultimate potential. Miss DeLay has that gift.
She challenges you at the same time that you feel
you are being nurtured.”

Hard Work and More Hard Work

But are challenge and love enough? Not quite. All
great teachers teach students how to reach the high
standards. Collins and Esquith didn't hand their
students a reading list and wish them bon voyage.
Collins's students read and discussed every line of
Macbeth in class. Esquith spent hours planning what
chapters they would read in class. “I know which
child will handle the challenge of the most difficult
paragraphs, and carefully plan a passage for the shy
youngster...who will begin his journey as a good
reader. Nothing is left to chance.....It takes enormous
energy, but to be in a room with young minds who
hang on every word of a classic book and beg for
more if I stop makes all the planning worthwhile.”
What are they teaching the students en route?
To love learning. To eventually learn and think for
themselves. And to work hard on the fundamentals.

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

Esquith’s class often met before school, after school,
and on school vacations to master the fundamen-
tals of English and math, especially as the work got
harder. His motto: “There are no shortcuts.” Collins
echoes that idea as she tells her class, “There is no
magic here. Mrs. Collins is no miracle worker. I do
not walk on water, I do not part the sea. I just love
children and work harder than a lot of people, and so
will you.”

DeLay expected a lot from her students, but she,
too, guided them there. Most students are intimi-
dated by the idea of talent, and it keeps them in
a fixed mindset. But DeLay demystified talent. One
student was sure he couldn't play a piece as fast as
Itzhak Perlman. So she didn’t let him see the metro-
nome until he had achieved it. “I know so surely
that if he had been handling that metronome, as he
approached that number he would have said to him-
self, can never do this as fast as Itzhak Perlman, and
he would have stopped himself.”

Another student was intimidated by the beautiful
sound made by talented violinists. “We were work-
ing on my sound, and there was this one note I
played, and Miss DeLay stopped me and said, ‘Now

that is a beautiful sound.” She then explained
how every note has to have a beautiful beginning,
middle, and end, leading into the next note. And
he thought, “Wow! If I can do it there, I can do it
everywhere.” Suddenly the beautiful sound of Perl-
man made sense and was not just an overwhelming
concept.

When students don’t know how to do something
and others do, the gap seems unbridgeable. Some
educators try to reassure their students that they're
just fine as they are. Growth-minded teachers tell
students the truth and then give them the tools to
close the gap. As Marva Collins said to a boy who was
clowning around in class, “You are in sixth grade and
your reading score is 1.1. I don’t hide your scores ina
folder. I tell them to you so you know what you have
to do. Now your clowning days are over.” Then they
got down to work.

Students Who Don’t Care

What about students who won't work, who don’t
care to learn? Here is a shortened version of an
interaction between Collins and Gary, a student who

refused to work, ripped up his homework assign-
ments, and would not participate in class. Collins is
trying to get him to go to the blackboard to do some
problems:

COLLINS: Sweetheart, what are you going to do? Use
your life or throw it away?

Gary: I’m not gonna do any damn work.

COLLINS: I am not going to give up on you. lam not
going to let you give up on yourself. If you sit there
leaning against this wall all day, you are going to
end up leaning on something or someone all your
life. And all that brilliance bottled up inside you
will go to waste.

At that, Gary agreed to go to the board, but then
refused to address the work there. After a while Col-
lins said:

“If you do not want to participate, go to the tele-
phone and tell your mother, ‘Mother, in this school
we have to learn, and Mrs. Collins says I can’t fool
around, so will you please pick me up.”

Gary started writing. Eventually, Gary became an
eager participant and an avid writer. Later that year,

the class was discussing Macbeth and how his mis-
guided thinking led him to commit murder. “It’s
sort of like Socrates says, isn't it, Miss Collins?”
Gary piped up. “Macbeth should have known that
‘Straight thinking leads to straight living’” For a
class assignment, he wrote, “Somnus, god of sleep,
please awaken us. While we sleep, ignorance takes
over the world....Take your spell off us. We don’t
have long before ignorance makes a coup d’état of
the world.”

When teachers are judging them, students will
sabotage the teacher by not trying. But when stu-
dents understand that school is for them—a way for
them to grow their minds—they do not insist on
sabotaging themselves.

In my work, I have seen tough guys shed tears
when they realize they can become smarter. It’s com-
mon for students to turn off to school and adopt
an air of indifference, but we make a mistake if we
think any student stops caring.

voting untold hours to the worst students? Are they
just saints? Is it reasonable to expect that everyone
can become a saint? The answer is that they’re not
entirely selfless. They love to learn. And teaching isa
wonderful way to learn. About people and how they
tick. About what you teach. About yourself. And
about life.

Fixed-minded teachers often think of themselves
as finished products. Their role is simply to impart
their knowledge. But doesn’t that get boring year
after year? Standing before yet another crowd of
faces and imparting. Now, that’s hard.

Seymour Sarason was a professor of mine when I
was in graduate school. He was a wonderful educa-
tor, and he always told us to question assumptions.
“There's an assumption,” he said, “that schools are
for students’ learning. Well, why aren’t they just as
much for teachers’ learning?” I never forgot that. In
all of my teaching, I think about what J find fascinat-
ing and what J would love to learn more about. I use
my teaching to grow, and that makes me, even after
all these years, a fresh and eager teacher.

One of Marva Collins's first mentors taught her
the same thing—that, above all, a good teacher is

one who continues to learn along with the students.
And she let her students know that right up front:
“Sometimes I don't like other grown-ups very much
because they think they know everything. I don’t
know everything. I can learn all the time.”

It's been said that Dorothy DeLay was an extra-
ordinary teacher because she was not interested in
teaching. She was interested in learning.

So, are great teachers born or made? Can any-
one be a Collins, Esquith, or DeLay? It starts with
the growth mindset—about yourself and about chil-
dren. Not just lip service to the idea that all children
can learn, but a deep desire to reach in and ignite the
mind of every child. Michael Lewis, in The New York
Times, tells of a coach who did this for him. “I had a
new taste for...extra work...and it didn’t take long to
figure out how much better my life could be if I ap-
plied this new zeal acquired on a baseball field to the
rest of it. It was as if this baseball coach had reached
inside me, found a rusty switch marked Turn On Be-
fore Attempting to Use and flipped it.”

Coaches are teachers, too, but their students’ suc-
cesses and failures are played out in front of crowds,
published in the newspapers, and written into the

record books. Their jobs rest on producing winners.
Let’s look closely at three legendary coaches to see
their mindsets in action.

COACHES: WINNING THROUGH MINDSET

Everyone who knows me well laughs when I say
someone is complicated. “What do you think of so-
and-so?” “Oh, he’s complicated.” It’s usually not a
compliment. It means that so-and-so may be capable
of great charm, warmth, and generosity, but there’s
an undercurrent of ego that can erupt at any time.
You never really know when you can trust him.

The fixed mindset makes people complicated. It
makes them worried about their fixed traits and cre-
ates the need to document them, sometimes at your
expense. And it makes them judgmental.

The Fixed-Mindset Coach in Action

Bobby Knight, the famous and controversial college
basketball coach, is complicated. He could be un-
believably kind. One time he passed up an important

reste 45 min danse chapite 7%

Page 409
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

and lucrative opportunity to be a sportscaster, be-
cause a former player of his had been in a bad acci-
dent. Knight rushed to his side and saw him through
the ordeal.

He could be extremely gracious. After the basket-
ball team he coached won the Olympic gold medal,
he insisted that the team pay homage first and fore-
most to Coach Henry Iba. Iba had never been given
proper respect for his Olympic accomplishments,
and in whatever way he could, Knight wanted to
make up for it. He had the team carry Coach Iba
around the floor on their shoulders.

Knight cared greatly about his players’ academic
records. He wanted them to get an education, and he
had a firm rule against missing classes or tutoring
sessions.

But he could also be cruel, and this cruelty came
from the fixed mindset. John Feinstein, author of
Season on the Brink, a book about Knight and his
team, tells us: “Knight was incapable of accepting
failure. Every defeat was personal; his team lost, a
team he had selected and coached....Failure on any
level all but destroyed him, especially failure in
coaching because it was coaching that gave him his

identity, made him special, set him apart.” A loss
made him a failure, obliterated his identity. So when
he was your coach—when your wins and losses
measured him—he was mercilessly judgmental. His
demeaning of players who let him down was, hope-
fully, without parallel.

In Daryl Thomas, Feinstein says, “Knight saw a
player of huge potential. Thomas had what coaches
call a ‘million dollar body’” He was big and strong,
but also fast. He could shoot the ball with his left
hand or his right hand. Knight couldn’t live with the
thought that Thomas and his million-dollar body
weren't bringing the team success:

“You know what you are Daryl? You are the worst
f pussy I’ve ever seen play basketball at this school.
The absolute worst pussy ever. You have more god-
dam ability than 95 percent of the players we've had
here but you are a pussy from the top of your head to
the bottom of your feet. An absolute f pussy. That’s
my assessment of you after three years.”

To make a similar point, Knight once put a Tampax
ina player's locker.

Thomas was a sensitive guy. An assistant coach
had given this advice: When he's calling you an ass-

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

hole, don’t listen. But when he starts telling you why
you're an asshole, listen. That way, you'll get better.
Thomas couldn't follow that advice. He heard every-
thing, and, after the tirade, he broke down right
there on the basketball court.

The ax of judgment came down on players who had
the audacity to lose a game. Often Knight did not
let the guilty parties ride back home with the rest
of the team. They were no longer worthy of respect-
ful treatment. One time, after his team reached the
semifinals of a national tournament (but not the na-
tional tournament), he was asked by an interviewer
what he liked best about the team. “What I like best
about this team right now,” Knight answered, “is the
fact that I only have to watch it play one more time.”

Some players could take it better than others. Steve
Alford, who went on to have a professional career,
had come to Indiana with clear goals in mind and
was able to maintain a strong growth focus much

wisdom and, for the most part, ignore the obscene
or demeaning parts of the tirades. But even he de-

Knight’s judgments, and how he himself became so

personally unhappy at some points that he lost his
zest for the sport.

“The atmosphere was poisonous....When I had
been playing well I had always stayed upbeat, no
matter how much Coach yelled....But now his nega-
tivism, piled on top of my own, was drowning me

love of the game going out of me.”

THE HOLY GRAIL: NO MISTAKES

Says Alford, “Coach's Holy Grail was the mistake-
free game.” Uh-oh. We know which mindset makes
mistakes intolerable. And Knight's explosions were
legendary. There was the time he threw the chair
across the court. There was the time he yanked his
player off the court by his jersey. There was the time
he grabbed his player by the neck. He often tried
to justify his behavior by saying he was toughening
the team up, preparing them to play under pressure.
But the truth is, he couldn’t control himself. Was the
chair a teaching exercise? Was the chokehold educa-
tional?

He motivated his players, not through respect
for them, but through intimidation—through fear.
They feared his judgments and explosions. Did it
work?

Sometimes it “worked.” He had three champion-
ship teams. In the “season on the brink” described
by John Feinstein, the team did not have size, experi-
ence, or quickness, but they were contenders. They
won twenty-one games, thanks to Knight's great
basketball knowledge and coaching skills.

But other times, it didn’t work. Individual players
or the team as a whole broke down. In the season on
the brink, they collapsed at the end of the season.
The year before, too, the team had collapsed under
Knight's pressure. Over the years, some players had
escaped by transferring to other schools, by break-
ing the rules (like cutting classes or skipping tu-
toring sessions), or by going early to the pros, like
Isiah Thomas. On a world tour, the players often
sat around fantasizing about where they should have
gone to school, if they hadn’t made the mistake of
choosing Indiana.

It’s not that Knight had a fixed mindset about
his players’ ability. He firmly believed in their cap-

acity to develop. But he had a fixed mindset about
himself and his coaching ability. The team was his
product, and they had to prove his ability every time
out. They were not allowed to lose games, make
mistakes, or question him in any way, because that
would reflect on his competence. Nor did he seem
to analyze his motivational strategies when they
weren't working. Maybe Daryl Thomas needed an-
other kind of incentive aside from ridicule or humili-
ation.

What are we to make of this complicated man as
a mentor to young players? His biggest star, Isiah
Thomas, expresses his profound ambivalence about
Knight. “You know there were times when if I hada
gun, I think I would have shot him. And there were
other times when I wanted to put my arms around
him, hug him, and tell him I loved him.”

I would not consider myself an unqualified success
if my best student had considered shooting me.

Coach John Wooden produced one of the greatest
championships records in sports. He led the UCLA
basketball team to the NCAA Championship in 1964,
1965, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973,
and 1975. There were seasons when his team was
undefeated, and they once had an eighty-eight-
game winning streak. All this I sort of knew.

What I didn’t know was that when Wooden ar-
rived at UCLA, it was a far cry from a basketball
dynasty. In fact, he didn’t want to work at UCLA at
all. He wanted to go to Minnesota. It was arranged
that Minnesota would phone him at six o'clock on a
certain evening to tell him if he had the job. He told
UCLA to call him at seven. No one called at six, six
thirty, or even six forty-five, so when UCLA called at
seven, he said yes. No sooner had he hung up than
the call from Minnesota came. A storm had messed
up the phone lines and prevented the six o'clock
phone call with the job offer from getting through.

UCLA had grossly inadequate facilities. For his first
sixteen years, Wooden held practice in a crowded,
dark, and poorly ventilated gym, known as the
B.O. Barn because of the atmospheric effect of the
sweating bodies. In the same gym, there were often

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

wrestling matches, gymnastics training, trampo-
line jumping, and cheerleading workouts going on
alongside basketball practice.

There was also no place for the games. For the first
few years, they had to use the B.O. Barn, and then for
fourteen more years, they had to travel around the
region borrowing gyms from schools and towns.

Then there were the players. When he put them
through their first practice, he was shattered. They
were so bad that if he’d had an honorable way to
back out of the job, he would have. The press had
(perceptively) picked his team to finish last in their
division, but Wooden went to work, and this laugh-
able team did not finish last. It won the division title,
with twenty-two wins and seven losses for the sea-
son. The next year, they went to the NCAA play-offs.

What did he give them? He gave them constant
training in the basic skills, he gave them condition-
ing, and he gave them mindset.

THE HOLY GRAIL: FULL PREPARATION AND FULL EFFORT

Wooden was not complicated. He was wise and

interesting, but not complicated. He was just a
straight-ahead growth-mindset guy who lived by
this rule: “You have to apply yourself each day to
becoming a little better. By applying yourself to the
task of becoming a little better each and every day
over a period of time, you will become a lot better.”

He didn’t ask for mistake-free games. He didn’t de-
mand that his players never lose. He asked for full
preparation and full effort from them. “Did I win?
Did I lose? Those are the wrong questions. The cor-
rect question is: Did I make my best effort?” If so, he
says, “You may be outscored but you will never lose.”

He was not a softy. He did not tolerate coasting. If
the players were coasting during practice, he turned
out the lights and left: “Gentlemen, practice is over.”
They had lost their opportunity to become better
that day.

EQUAL TREATMENT

Like DeLay, Wooden gave equal time and attention
to all of his players, regardless of their initial skills.
They, in turn, gave all, and blossomed. Here is
Wooden talking about two new players when they

arrived at UCLA: “I looked at each one to see what
he had and then said to myself, ‘Oh gracious, if he
can make a real contribution, a playing contribution,
to our team then we must be pretty lousy.’ However,
what I couldn't see was what these men had inside.”
Both gave just about everything they could possibly
give and both became starters, one as the starting
center on a national championship team.

He respected all players equally. You know how
some players’ numbers are retired after they move
on, in homage to their greatness? No player's num-
ber was retired while Wooden was coach, although
he had some of the greatest players of all time,
like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton. Later on,
when their numbers were retired, he was against it.
“Other fellows who played on our team also wore
those numbers. Some of those other players gave me
close to everything they had....The jersey and the
number on it never belong to just one single player,
no matter how great or how big a ‘star’ that par-
ticular player is. It goes against the whole concept of
what ateamis.”

Wait a minute. He was in the business of win-
ning games. Don’t you have to go with your talented

players and give less to the second stringers? Well,
he didn’t play all players equally, but he gave to all
players equally. For example, when he recruited an-
other player the same year as Bill Walton, he told
him that he would play very little in actual games
because of Walton. But he promised him, “By the
time you graduate you'll get a pro contract. You'll be
that good.” By his third year, the player was giving
Bill Walton all he could handle in practice. And when
he turned pro, he was named rookie of the year in his
league.

PREPARING PLAYERS FOR LIFE

Was Wooden a genius, a magician able to turn me-
diocre players into champions? Actually, he admits
that in terms of basketball tactics and strategies, he
was quite average. What he was really good at was
analyzing and motivating his players. With these
skills he was able to help his players fulfill their po-
tential, not just in basketball, but in life—something
he found even more rewarding than winning games.

Did Wooden's methods work? Aside from the ten
championship titles, we have the testimony of his
players, none of whom refer to firearms.

Bill Walton, Hall of Famer: “Of course, the real com-
petition he was preparing us for was life....He taught
us the values and characteristics that could make us
not only good players, but also good people.”

Denny Crum, successful coach: “I can’t imagine
what my life would have been had Coach Wooden
not been my guiding light. As the years pass, I ap-
preciate him more and more and can only pray that I
can have half as much influence on the young people
Icoach as he has had on me.”

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Hall of Famer: “The wisdom
of Coach Wooden had a profound influence on me as
an athlete, but an even greater influence on me as a
human being. He is responsible, in part, for the per-
son Iam today.”

Listen to this story.

It was the moment of victory. UCLA had just won
its first national championship. But Coach Wooden
was worried about Fred Slaughter, a player who had
started every game and had had a brilliant year up
until this final, championship game. The game had

not been going well, and, as it got worse and worse,
Wooden felt a change had to made. So he pulled Fred.
The replacement player did a great job, and Wooden
left him in until the game was virtually won.

The victory was a peak moment. Not only had they
just won their first NCAA title by beating Duke, but
they had ended the season with thirty wins and zero
losses. Yet Wooden's concern for Fred dampened his
euphoria. As Wooden left the press conference and
went to find Fred, he opened the door to the dressing
room. Fred was waiting for him. “Coach...I want you
to know I understand. You had to leave Doug in there
because he played so well, and I didn’t. I wanted to
play in the worst way, but I do understand, and if
anyone says I was upset, it’s not true. Disappointed,
yes, but upset, no, And I was very happy for Doug,”

“There are coaches out there,” Wooden says, “who
have won championships with the dictator ap-
proach, among them Vince Lombardi and Bobby
Knight. I had a different philosophy....For me, con-
cern, compassion, and consideration were always
priorities of the highest order.”

Read the story of Fred Slaughter again and you tell
me whether, under the same circumstances, Coach

Knight would have rushed to console Daryl Thomas.
And would Knight have allowed Thomas to reach
down to find his pride, dignity, and generosity in his
moment of disappointment?

Which Is the Enemy: Success or Failure?

Pat Summitt was the coach of the Tennessee
women’s basketball team, the Lady Vols. She coached
them to eight national championships. She didn’t
come into the game with Wooden's philosophical
attitude, but was at first more Knight-like in her
stance. Every time the team lost, she couldn't let go
of it. She continued to live it, beating it to death
and torturing herself and the team with it. Then she
graduated to a love-hate relationship with losing.
Emotionally, it still made her feel sick. But she loved
what it did. It forces everyone, players and coaches,
to develop a more complete game. It was success
that had become the enemy.

Wooden calls it being “infected” with success.
Pat Riley, former coach of the championship Los
Angeles Lakers team, calls it the “disease of me”’—
thinking you are the success, and chucking the dis-

cipline and the work that got you there. Summitt
explained, “Success lulls you. It makes the most am-
bitious of us complacent and sloppy.” As Summitt
spoke, Tennessee had won five NCAA Champion-
ships, but only once when they were favored to win.
“On every other occasion, we were upset. We've lost
as many as four or five titles that we were predicted
to win.”

After the 1996 championship, the team was com-
placent. The older players were the national cham-
pions, and the new players expected to be swept to
victory merely by being at Tennessee. It was a disas-
ter. They began to lose and lose badly. On December
15, they were crushed by Stanford on their own
home court. A few games later, they were crushed
again. Now they had five losses and everyone had
given up on them. The North Carolina coach, mean-
ing to comfort Summitt, told her, “Well, just hang
in there ’til next year.” HBO had come to Tennes-
see to film a documentary, but now the producers
were looking for another team. Even her assistants
were thinking they wouldn't make it into the March
championship play-offs.

So before the next game, Summitt met with the
team for five hours. That night, they played Old Do-
minion, the second-ranked team in the country. For
the first time that season, they gave all. But they lost
again. It was devastating. They had invested, gone
for it, and still lost. Some were sobbing so hard, they
couldn't speak, or even breathe. “Get your heads up,”
Summitt told them. “If you give effort like this all the
time, if you fight like this, I’m telling you, I promise
you, we'll be there in March.” Two months later they
were the national champions.

Conclusion? Beware of success. It can knock you
into a fixed mindset: “I won because I have talent.
Therefore I will keep winning.” Success can infect a
team or it can infect an individual. Alex Rodriguez,
the baseball star, was not infected with success. “You
never stay the same,” he says. “You either go one way
or the other.”

FALSE GROWTH MINDSET

I have seen many parents, teachers, and coaches
apply growth-mindset concepts in the most spec-
tacular ways, with wonderful results. Using mind-

set principles, many schools and sports teams have
risen to the top—they’ve been recognized for their
outstanding culture of learning (and teamwork) and
for their exceptional achievements. Needless to say,
this has been extremely gratifying.

Then, a couple of years ago, my colleague in Aus-
tralia, Susan Mackie, told me she was seeing an
outbreak—of “false growth mindset.” I didn’t know
what she was talking about. In fact, I was a bit ir-
ritated. Isn’t a growth mindset a pretty simple and
straightforward idea? Why would anyone have a
false growth mindset if they could have a real one?

But she had planted the seed, and as I went about
my business, I soon realized what she meant. Some
parents, teachers, and coaches were indeed misun-
derstanding the mindset ideas. All at once I became
determined to understand their misunderstandings
and to figure out how to correct them. So let’s take
a closer look at 1) what a growth mindset is and is
not, 2) how to achieve it, and 3) how to pass it on to
others.

What a Growth Mindset Is and Is Not

A growth mindset is about believing people can
develop their abilities. It’s that simple. It can have
many repercussions, but that’s what it is at its core.
Nonetheless, many people project a different mean-
ing onto it.

Misunderstanding #1. Many people take what they
like about themselves and call it a “growth mind-
set.” If they're open-minded or flexible, they say they
have a growth mindset. I often hear people calling it

in “open mindset.” But there's a difference between
being flexible or open-minded and being dedicated
to growing talent. And if people drift away from the
actual meaning of a growth mindset, they drift away
from its benefits. They can bask in their own won-
derful qualities but they may never do the hard work
of cultivating their own abilities or the abilities of
their children or students.

Misunderstanding #2. Many people believe that
a growth mindset is only about effort, especially
praising effort. I talked earlier about how praising
the process children engage in—their hard work,

Areste21 min danse chapitre 78%


==================================================
Page 427
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

strategies, focus, perseverance—can foster a growth
mindset. In this way, children learn that the process
they engage in brings about progress and learning,
and that their learning does not just magically flow
from some innate ability.

The first important thing to remember here is that
the process includes more than just effort. Certainly,
we want children to appreciate the fruits of hard
work. But we also want them to understand the
importance of trying new strategies when the one
they’re using isn’t working. (We don’t want them to
just try harder with the same ineffective strategy.)
And we want them to ask for help or input from
others when it’s needed. This is the process we want
them to appreciate: hard work, trying new strat-
egies, and seeking input from others.

Another pitfall is praising effort (or any part of
the process) that’s not there. More than once, par-
ents have said to me, “I praise my child’s effort but
it’s not working.” [immediately ask, “Was your child
actually trying hard?” “Well, not really,” comes the
sheepish reply. We should never think that praising
a process that is not there will bring good results.

Areste 19 mindans le chapive 78%


==================================================
Page 428
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

But a problem that’s of even greater concern to me
is the fact that some teachers and coaches are using
effort praise as a consolation prize when kids are not
learning. If a student has tried hard and made lit-
tle or no progress, we can of course appreciate their
effort, but we should never be content with effort
that is not yielding further benefits. We need to fig-
ure out why that effort is not effective and guide kids
toward other strategies and resources that can help
them resume learning.

Recently, someone asked me, “What keeps you up
at night?” And I said, “It’s the fear that the mindset
concept will be used to make kids feel good when
they’re not learning—just like the failed self-esteem
movement.” The growth mindset is meant to help
kids learn, not to paper over the fact that they are
not learning.

Finally, when people realize I'm the mindset per-
son, they often say, “Oh, yea! Praise the process not
the outcome, right?” Well, not quite. This is such
acommon misconception. In all of our research on
praise, we indeed praise the process, but we tie it to
the outcome, that is, to children’s learning, progress,

reste 18 min dans le chapive 78%


==================================================
Page 429
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

or achievements. Children need to understand that
engaging in that process helped them learn.

Not long ago, a mother told me how very frustrat-
ing it was that she was not allowed to praise her
daughter when the child did something wonderful
—that she could only praise her when she was strug-
gling. No! No! No! Of course you can appreciate your
children’s wonderful accomplishments, but then tie
those accomplishments to the process they engaged
in.

And remember, we don’t have to always be prais-
ing. Inquiring about the child’s process and just
showing interest in it goes a very long way.

Misunderstanding #3. A growth mindset equals
telling kids they can do anything. Many’s the time
I've heard educators say, “I've always had a growth
mindset. I always tell my students, ‘You can do any-
thing!” Few people believe in children’s potential as
much as I do, or yearn to see all children fulfill their
enormous promise. But it doesn't happen by simply
telling them, “You can do anything.” It happens by
helping them gain the skills and find the resources
to make progress toward their goals. Otherwise, it’s
an empty reassurance. It puts the onus entirely on

the student and may make them feel like a failure if
they don’t reach their goals.

One final word about putting the onus on the stu-
dent. It broke my heart to learn that some educators
and coaches were blaming kids for having a fixed
mindset—scolding or criticizing them for not dis-
playing growth-mindset qualities. Notice that these
adults were absolving themselves of the responsi-
bility, not only for teaching a growth mindset but
also for the child’s learning: “I can’t teach this child.
He has a fixed mindset.” Let’s be totally clear here.
We as educators must take seriously our responsibil-
ity to create growth-mindset-friendly environments
—where kids feel safe from judgment, where they
understand that we believe in their potential to
grow, and where they know that we are totally dedi-
cated to collaborating with them on their learning.
We are in the business of helping kids thrive, not
finding reasons why they can't.

How Do You Get a (True) Growth Mindset?

You don’t get a growth mindset by proclamation.
You move toward it by taking a journey.

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

As a growth mindset gained currency and became
the “correct” way to think in some quarters, more
and more people claimed to have it. It sort of makes
sense. Don’t we all want to see ourselves as enlight-
ened people who help children fulfill their poten-
tial? A noted educator told me that it had become
politically incorrect for educators to even talk about
(and maybe even think about) having a fixed mind-
set in any area. And a principal told me that he was
recently giving some mild suggestions to a teacher
when she looked at him indignantly and sai
you implying I have a fixed mindset?”

Although for simplicity I’ve talked as though some
people have a growth mindset and some people have
a fixed mindset, in truth we're all a mixture of the
two. There's no point denying it. Sometimes we're
in one mindset and sometimes we're in the other.
Our task then becomes to understand what triggers
our fixed mindset. What are the events or situations
that take us to a place where we feel our (or other
people's) abilities are fixed? What are the events or
situations that take us to a place of judgment rather
than toa place of development?

What happens when our fixed-mindset “persona”
shows up—the character within who warns us to
avoid challenges and beats us up when we fail at
something? How does that persona make us feel?
What does it make us think and how does it make
us act? How do those thoughts, feelings, and actions
affect us and those around us? And, most important,
what can we do over time to keep that persona from
interfering with our growth and that of our chil-
dren? How can we persuade that fixed-mindset per-
sona to get on board with the goals that spring from
our growth mindset?

I'll address these questions in the final chapter as
‘we examine the process of personal change. What I
will emphasize here is that it is a long journey, one
that takes commitment and persistence. But once
we acknowledge that we all have recurrent fixed
mindsets, we can talk to one another openly. We can
talk about our fixed-mindset personas, when they
show up, how they affect us, and how we're learning
to deal with them. And as we do, we will realize that
we have lots of fellow travelers on our journey.

How Do You Pass a Growth Mindset On?

You would think that once adults adopted more of
a growth mindset they would automatically pass it
on to kids. It would simply ooze out in their words
and deeds. That’s what we thought, but it’s not what
we're finding. Many adults are not passing on their
growth mindsets. How is that possible?

First, let’s look at the findings. In a number of
studies, we and researchers looked at the mind-
sets of parents and their children. In each case,
many parents held a growth mindset, but they were
not necessarily passing it on to their children. In
other studies, researchers looked at the mindsets
of teachers and their students. In each case, many
teachers held a growth mindset, but they were not
necessarily passing it on to their students. Some-
thing else was going on.

Of course, it’s possible that some of these parents
or teachers had false growth mindsets. But beyond
that, we're finding something fascinating. Adults’
mindsets are in their heads and are not directly
visible to children. Adults’ overt actions speak far

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

louder, and this is what children are picking up on.
Unfortunately, these actions often don’t line up with
the growth mindsets in adults’ heads. So what are
the actions that convey the different mindsets?

First, no surprise, it’s the praise. Parents’ praise
molds their children’s mindsets. It’s interesting that
this doesn’t necessarily line up with the parents’
mindsets. Even parents who hold a growth mindset
can find themselves praising their child’s ability—
and neglecting to focus on their child’s learning pro-
cess. It can be hard to shake the idea that telling kids
they’re smart will build their confidence.

Second, it’s the way adults respond to children’s
mistakes or failures. When a child has a setback and
the parent reacts with anxiety or with concern about
the child’s ability, this fosters more of a fixed mind-
set in the child. The parent may try to gloss over the
child’s failure but the very act of doing so may con-
vey that the failure is an issue. So, although parents
may hold a growth mindset, they may still display
worry about their child’s confidence or morale when
the child stumbles.

It’s the parents who respond to their children’s set-
backs with interest and treat them as opportunities

for learning who are transmitting a growth mind-
set to their children. These parents think setbacks
are good things that should be embraced, and that
setbacks should be used as a platform for learning.
They address the setback head-on and talk to their
children about the next steps for learning.

In other words, every single day parents are teach-
ing their children whether mistakes, obstacles, and
setbacks are bad things or good things. The parents
who treat them as good things are more likely to
pass ona growth mindset to their children.

Third, passing on a growth mindset is about
whether teachers are teaching for understanding or
are simply asking students to memorize facts, rules,
and procedures. Research is showing that when
teachers care about deeper understanding and work
with students to achieve it, then students are more
likely to believe that their abilities can be devel-
oped. One study found that when math teachers
taught for conceptual understanding, gave feedback
that deepened students’ understanding, and then al-
lowed students to revise their work (to experience
and show their deeper understanding), their stu-
dents moved toward a growth mindset in math.

On the other hand, when teachers thought of math
as just a set of rules and procedures to memorize,
they could emphasize the importance of effort or
persistence, but students could not feel their abil-
ities growing and did not tend to move toward a
growth mindset. By the way, many of these teachers
used the words “growth mindset” in their class-
rooms, but their teaching methods—their actions—
did not foster that growth mindset in their students.

Other studies paint a similar picture. In one
study, high school students talked about their math
teachers. Some of them said that when they were
stuck, their teacher sat down with them and said
things like this: “Show me what you've done, let’s try
to understand how you're thinking, and then let’s
figure out what you should try next.” The students
who were treated like this—as though understand-
ing was of paramount importance and could be
achieved with support from the teacher—were mov-
ing toward a growth mindset in math.

Yet in this era of high-stakes testing, much teach-
ing emphasizes memorization of facts, rules, and

procedures to “insure” that students do well on the
all-important tests. As we have seen, this may pro-
mote more fixed mindsets and perhaps, ironically,
undermine students’ performance on these very
tests. There is nothing like deep learning to insure
good outcomes.

Sadly, in this atmosphere many students are com-
ing to equate learning with memorizing. I am hear-
ing from many researchers and educators that stu-
dents across the economic spectrum are becoming
increasingly unable to grasp the difference between
memorizing facts, rules, and procedures and truly
understanding the concepts underlying the mater-
ial. Aside from the bad news for growth mindsets,
this also has disturbing implications for our nation.
Great contributions to society are born of curiosity
and deep understanding. If students no longer rec-
ognize and value deep learning, where will the great
contributions of the future come from?

‘We were initially surprised to find that many adults
with growth mindsets were not passing them on.
However, the moral of this story is that parents,

teachers, and coaches pass on a growth mindset not
by having a belief sitting in their heads but by em-
bodying a growth mindset in their deeds: the way
they praise (conveying the processes that lead to
learning), the way they treat setbacks (as opportun-
ities for learning), and the way they focus on deep-
ening understanding (as the goal of learning).

OUR LEGACY

As parents, teachers, and coaches, we are entrusted
with people's lives. They are our responsibility and
our legacy. We now know that the growth mindset
has a key role to play in helping us fulfill our mission
and in helping them fulfill their potential.

of judging the players, give them the re-

Chapter 8

CHANGING MINDSETS

The growth mindset is based on the belief in change,
and the most gratifying part of my work is watching
people change. Nothing is better than seeing people
find their way to things they value. This chapter is
about kids and adults who found their way to using
their abilities. And about how all of us can do that.

THE NATURE OF CHANGE

I was in the middle of first grade when my family
moved. Suddenly I was in a new school. Everything
was unfamiliar—the teacher, the students, and the
work. The work was what terrified me. The new
class was way ahead of my old one, or at least it

Page 444

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

seemed that way to me. They were writing letters I
hadn’t learned to write yet. And there was a way to
do everything that everyone seemed to know except
me. So when the teacher said, “Class, put your name
on your paper in the right place,” I had no idea what
she meant.

So I cried. Each day things came up that I didn’t
know how to do. Each time, I felt lost and over-
whelmed. Why didn’t I just say to the teacher, “Mrs.
Kahn, I haven’t learned this yet. Could you show me
how?”

Another time when I was little, my parents gave
me money to go to the movies with an adult and a
group of kids. As I rounded the corner to the meet-
ing place, I looked down the block and saw them
all leaving. But instead of running after them and
yelling, “Wait for me!” I stood frozen, clutching the
coins in my hand and watching them recede into the
distance.

Why didn’t I try to stop them or catch up with
them? Why did I accept defeat before I had tried
some simple tactics? I know that in my dreams I had
often performed magical or superhuman feats in the
face of danger. I even have a picture of myself in my

self-made Superman cape. Why, in real life, couldn’t
Ido an ordinary thing like ask for help or call out for
people to wait?

In my work, I see lots of young children like this—
bright, seemingly resourceful children who are para-
lyzed by setbacks. In some of our studies, they just
have to take the simplest action to make things bet-
ter. But they don’t. These are the young children
with the fixed mindset. When things go wrong, they
feel powerless and incapable.

Even now, when something goes wrong or when
something promising seems to be slipping away, I
still have a passing feeling of powerlessness. Does
that mean I haven't changed?

No, it means that change isn’t like surgery. Even
when you change, the old beliefs aren't just removed
like a worn-out hip or knee and replaced with better
ones. Instead, the new beliefs take their place along-
side the old ones, and as they become stronger, they
give you a different way to think, feel, and act.

Beliefs Are the Key to Happiness (and to Misery)

In the 1960s, psychiatrist Aaron Beck was working

reste 1 heur et 40 min danse chapire 78%


==================================================
Page 446
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

with his clients when he suddenly realized it was
their beliefs that were causing their problems. Just
before they felt a wave of anxiety or depression,
something quickly flashed through their minds. It
could be: “Dr. Beck thinks I’m incompetent.” Or “This
therapy will never work. I’ll never feel better.” These
kinds of beliefs caused their negative feelings not
only in the therapy session, but in their lives, too.

They weren't beliefs people were usually conscious
of. Yet Beck found he could teach people to pay atten-
tion and hear them. And then he discovered he could
teach them how to work with and change these be-
liefs. This is how cognitive therapy was born, one of
the most effective therapies ever developed.

Whether they’re aware of it or not, all people keep a
running account of what’s happening to them, what
it means, and what they should do. In other words,
our minds are constantly monitoring and interpret-
ing. That’s just how we stay on track. But sometimes
the interpretation process goes awry. Some people
put more extreme interpretations on things that
happen—and then react with exaggerated feelings
of anxiety, depression, or anger. Or superiority.

==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

Mindsets Go Further

Mindsets frame the running account that’s taking
place in people’s heads. They guide the whole in-
terpretation process. The fixed mindset creates an
internal monologue that is focused on judging: “This
means I’m a loser.” “This means I’m a better per-
son than they are.” “This means I'm a bad husband.”
“This means my partner is selfish.”

In several studies, we probed the way people with
a fixed mindset dealt with information they were re-
ceiving. We found that they put a very strong evalu-
ation on each and every piece of information. Some-
thing good led to a very strong positive label and
something bad led to a very strong negative label.

People with a growth mindset are also constantly
monitoring what's going on, but their internal
monologue is not about judging themselves and
others in this way. Certainly they’re sensitive to
positive and negative information, but they're at-
tuned to its implications for learning and construct-
ive action: What can I learn from this? How can Iim-
prove? How can I help my partner do this better?

Now, cognitive therapy basically teaches people to
rein in their extreme judgments and make them
more reasonable. For example, suppose Alana does
poorly on a test and draws the conclusion, “I'm
stupid.” Cognitive therapy would teach her to look
more closely at the facts by asking: What is the evi-
dence for and against your conclusion? Alana may,
after prodding, come up with a long list of ways in
which she has been competent in the past, and may
then confess, “I guess I’m not as incompetent as I
thought.”

She may also be encouraged to think of reasons she
did poorly on the test other than stupidity, and these
may further temper her negative judgment. Alana is
then taught how to do this for herself, so that when
she judges herself negatively in the future, she can
refute the judgment and feel better.

In this way, cognitive therapy helps people make
more realistic and optimistic judgments. But it does
not take them out of the fixed mindset and its world of
judgment. It does not confront the basic assumption
—the idea that traits are fixed—that is causing them
to constantly measure themselves. In other words, it

does not escort them out of the framework of judg-
ment and into the framework of growth.

This chapter is about changing the internal mono-
logue from a judging one to a growth-oriented one.

THE MINDSET LECTURES

Just learning about the growth mindset can cause a
big shift in the way people think about themselves
and their lives.

So each year in my undergraduate course, I teach
about these mindsets—not only because they are
part of the topic of the course but also because I
know what pressure these students are under. Every
year, students describe to me how these ideas have
changed them in all areas of their lives.

Here is Maggie, the aspiring writer:

I recognized that when it comes to artis-
tic or creative endeavors I had internalized
a fixed mindset. I believed that people were
inherently artistic or creative and that you
could not improve through effort. This dir-

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

ectly affected my life because I have always
wanted to be a writer, but have been afraid
to pursue any writing classes or to share my
creative writing with others. This is directly
related to my mindset because any negative
criticism would mean that I am not a writer
inherently. I was too scared to expose myself
to the possibility that I might not be a “nat-
ural.”

Now after listening to your lectures, Ihave
decided to register for a creative writing
class next term. And I feel that I have really
come to understand what was preventing
me from pursuing an interest that has long
been my secret dream. I really feel this infor-
mation has empowered me!

Maggie's internal monologue used to say: Don’t do
it. Don’t take a writing class. Don't share your writing
with others. It’s not worth the risk. Your dream could be

destroyed. Protect it.

Now it says: Go for it. Make it happen. Develop your

skills. Pursue your dream.
And here's Jason, the athlete:

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC.

As a student athlete at Columbia I had ex-
clusively the fixed mindset. Winning was
everything and learning did not enter the
picture. However, after listening to your lec-
tures, I realized that this is not a good mind-
set. I've been working on learning while I
compete, under the realization that if I can
continually improve, even in matches, I will
become a much better athlete.

© Jason’s internal monologue used to be: Win. Win.
You have to win. Prove yourself. Everything depends on
it.
Now it’s: Observe. Learn. Improve. Become a better
athlete.

And finally, here’s Tony, the recovering genius:

In high school I was able to get top grades
with minimal studying and sleeping. Icame
to believe that it would always be so be-
cause I was naturally gifted with a super-
ior understanding and memory. However,
after about a year of sleep deprivation my

understanding and memory began to not be
so superior anymore. When my natural tal-
ents, which I had come to depend on almost
entirely for my self-esteem (as opposed to
my ability to focus, my determination or my
ability to work hard), came into question, I
went through a personal crisis that lasted
until a few weeks ago when you discussed
the different mindsets in class. Understand-
ing that a lot of my problems were the result
of my preoccupation with proving myself to
be “smart” and avoiding failures has really
helped me get out of the self-destructive
pattern I was living in.

Tony’s internal monologue went from: I’m natur-
ally gifted. I don’t need to study. I don’t need to sleep.
I'm superior.

To: Uh-oh, I’m losing it. I can’t understand things, I
can’t remember things. What am I now?

To: Don’t worry so much about being smart. Don’t
worry so much about avoiding failures. That becomes
self-destructive. Let’s start to study and sleep and get
on with life.

Of course, these people will have setbacks and dis-
appointments, and sticking to the growth mindset
may not always be easy. But just knowing it gave
them another way to be. Instead of being held cap-
tive by some intimidating fantasy about the Great
Writer, the Great Athlete, or the Great Genius, the
growth mindset gave them courage to embrace their
own goals and dreams. And more important, it gave
them a way to work toward making them real.

A MINDSET WORKSHOP

Adolescence, as we've seen, is a time when hordes
of kids turn off to school. You can almost hear the
stampede as they try to get as far from learning as
possible. This is a time when students are facing
some of the biggest challenges of their young lives,
and a time when they are heavily evaluating them-
selves, often with a fixed mindset. It is precisely the
kids with the fixed mindset who panic and run for
cover, showing plummeting motivation and grades.

Over the past few years, we've developed a work-
shop for these students. It teaches them the growth

mindset and how to apply it to their schoolwork.
Here is part of what they’re told:

Many people think of the brain as a mystery.
They don’t know much about intelligence
and how it works. When they do think about
what intelligence is, many people believe
that a person is born either smart, average,
or dumb—and stays that way for life. But
new research shows that the brain is more
like a muscle—it changes and gets stronger
when you use it. And scientists have been
able to show just how the brain grows and
gets stronger when you learn.

We then describe how the brain forms new con-
nections and “grows” when people practice and
learn new things.

When you learn new things, these tiny con-
nections in the brain actually multiply and
get stronger. The more that you challenge
your mind to learn, the more your brain
cells grow. Then, things that you once found

very hard or even impossible—like speaking
a foreign language or doing algebra—seem
to become easy. The result is a stronger,
smarter brain.

We go on to point out that nobody laughs at babies
and says how dumb they are because they can’t talk.
They just haven't learned yet. We show students
pictures of how the density of brain connections
changes during the first years of life as babies pay
attention, study their world, and learn how to do
things.

Over a series of sessions, through activities and
discussions, students are taught study skills and
shown how to apply the lessons of the growth mind-
set to their studying and their schoolwork.

Students love learning about the brain, and the
discussions are very lively. But even more rewarding
are the comments students make about themselves.
Let's revisit Jimmy, the hard-core turned-off student
from chapter 3. In our very first workshop, we were
amazed to hear him say with tears in his eyes: “You
mean I don’t have to be dumb?”

feeling dumb. Our workshop told Jimmy, “You're in
charge of your mind. You can help it grow by using
it in the right way.” And as the workshop progressed,
here is what Jimmy’s teacher said about him:

Jimmy, who never puts in any extra effort
and often doesn’t turn in homework on
time, actually stayed up late working for
hours to finish an assignment early so I
could review it and give him a chance to re-
vise it. He earned a B+ on the assignment (he
had been getting C’s and lower).

Incidentally, teachers weren't just trying to be nice
to us by telling us what we wanted to hear. The
teachers didn’t know who was in our growth-mind-
set workshop. This was because we had another
workshop too. This workshop met just as many
times, and taught them even more study skills. And
students got just as much personal attention from
supportive tutors. But they didn't learn the growth
mindset and how to apply it.

reste heure et 26 min danse chapitre 80%


==================================================
Page 457
==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

Teachers didn’t know which of their students went
to which of the workshops, but they still singled
out Jimmy and many of the students in the growth-
mindset workshop to tell us that they’d seen real
changes in their motivation to learn and improve.

Lately I have noticed that some students
have a greater appreciation for improve-
ment....R. was performing below stand-
ards....He has learned to appreciate the im-
provement from his grades of 52, 46, and 49
to his grades of 67 and 71....He valued his
growth in learning Mathematics.

M. was far below grade level. During the past
several weeks, she has voluntarily asked for
extra help from me during her lunch period
in order to improve her test-taking perform-
ance. Her grades drastically improved from
failing to an 84 on the most recent exam.

Positive changes in motivation and behavior
are noticeable in K. and J. They have begun
to work hard on a consistent basis.

==================================================

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

Several students have voluntarily partici
pated in peer tutoring sessions during their
lunch periods or after school. Students such
as N. and S. were passing when they re-
quested the extra help and were motivated
by the prospect of sheer improvement.

We were eager to see whether the workshop
affected students’ grades, so, with their permission,
we looked at students’ final marks at the end of the
semester. We looked especially at their math grades,
since these reflected real learning of challenging
new concepts.

Before the workshops, students’ math grades had
been suffering badly. But afterward, lo and behold,
students who'd been in the growth-mindset work-
shop showed a jump in their grades. They were now
clearly doing better than the students who'd been in
the other workshop.

The growth-mindset workshop—just eight ses-
sions long—had a real impact. This one adjustment
of students’ beliefs seemed to unleash their brain
power and inspire them to work and achieve. Of
course, they were in a school where the teachers

were responsive to their outpouring of motivation,
and were willing to put in the extra work to help
them learn. Even so, these findings show the power
of changing mindsets.

The students in the other workshop did not im-
prove. Despite their eight sessions of training in
study skills and other good things, they showed no
gains. Because they were not taught to think differ-
ently about their minds, they were not motivated to
put the skills into practice.

The mindset workshop put students in charge of
their brains. Freed from the vise of the fixed mind-
set, Jimmy and others like him could now use their
minds more freely and fully.

BRAINOLOGY

The problem with the workshop was that it required
a big staff to deliver it. This wouldn't be feasible
on a large scale. Plus, the teachers weren't directly
involved. They could be a big factor in helping to
sustain the students’ gains. So we decided to put
our workshop on interactive computer modules and

have teachers guide their classes through the mod-
ules.

With the advice of educational experts, media ex-
perts, and brain experts, we developed the “Brain-
ology”™ program. It presents animated figures,
Chris and Dahlia—seventh graders who are cool but
are having problems with their schoolwork. Dah-
lia is having trouble with Spanish, and Chris with
math. They visit the lab of Dr. Cerebrus, a slightly
mad brain scientist, who teaches them all about the
brain and the care and feeding of it. He teaches
them what to do for maximum performance from
the brain (like sleeping enough, eating the right
things, and using good study strategies) and he
teaches them how the brain grows as they learn.
The program, all along, shows students how Chris
and Dahlia apply these lessons to their schoolwork.
The interactive portions allow students to do brain
experiments, see videos of real students with their
problems and study strategies, recommend study
plans for Chris and Dahlia, and keep a journal of
their own problems and study plans.

Here are some of the seventh graders writing about
how this program changed them:

study and master the skills....1 have been
using my time more wisely, studying every
day and reviewing the notes that I took
on that day. I am really glad that I joined
this program because it increased my intelli-
gence about the brain.

I did change my mind about how the brain
works and i do things differently. i will try
harder because i know that the more you try
the more your brain works.

ALL ican say is that Brainology changed my
grades. Bon Voyage!

Thank you for making us study more and
helping us build up our brain! I actually
picture my neurons growing bigger as they
make more connections.

Teachers told us how formerly turned-off students
were now talking the Brainology talk. For example,
they were taught that when they studied well and
learned something, they transferred it from tempor-
ary storage (working memory) to more permanent
storage (long-term memory). Now they were saying
to each other: “I'll have to put that into my long-
term memory.” “Sorry, that stuff is not in my long-
term memory.” “I guess I was only using my working
memory.”

Teachers said that students were also offering to
practice, study, take notes, or pay attention more to
make sure that neural connections would be made.
As one student said:

“Yes the [Blrainology program helped a lot....Every
time I thought about not doing work I remembered
that my neurons could grow if I did do the work.”

The teachers also changed. Not only did they
say great things about how their students bene-

fited, they also said great things about the insights
they themselves had gained. In particular, they said
Brainology was essential for understanding:

“That all students can learn, even the ones who
struggle with math and with self-control.”

“That I have to be more patient because learning
takes a great deal of time and practice.”

“How the brain works....Each learner learns differ-
ently. Brainology assisted me in teaching for various
learning styles.”

Our workshop went to children in twenty schools.
Some children admitted to being skeptical at first:
used to think it was just free time anda good cartoon
but i started listening to it and i started doing what
they told me to do.” In the end, almost all children re-
ported meaningful benefits.

Is change easy or hard? So far it sounds easy. Simply
learning about the growth mindset can sometimes

thinks the paper has potential, you will be invited
to revise it and resubmit it provided you can address
every criticism.

My student reminded me of the time she had sent
her thesis research to the top journal in our field.
When the reviews came back, she was devastated.
She had been judged—the work was flawed and, by
extension, so was she. Time passed, but she couldn’t
bring herself to go near the reviews again or work on
the paper.

Then I told her to change her mindset. “Look,” I
said, “it’s not about you. That’s their job. Their job
is to find every possible flaw. Your job is to learn
from the critique and make your paper even better.”
Within hours she was revising her paper, which was
warmly accepted. She tells me: “I never felt judged
again. Never. Every time I get that critique, I tell my-

self, ‘Oh, that’s their job,’ and I get to work immedi-
ately on my job.”

But change is also hard.

When people hold on to a fixed mindset, it’s often
for a reason. At some point in their lives it served a
good purpose for them. It told them who they were
or who they wanted to be (a smart, talented child)
and it told them how to be that (perform well). In
this way, it provided a formula for self-esteem and a
path to love and respect from others.

The idea that they are worthy and will be loved is
crucial for children, and—if a child is unsure about
being valued or loved—the fixed mindset appears to
offer a simple, straightforward route to this.

Psychologists Karen Horney and Carl Rogers, work-
ingin the mid-1900s, both proposed theories of chil-
dren’s emotional development. They believed that
when young children feel insecure about being ac-
cepted by their parents, they experience great anx-
iety. They feel lost and alone in a complicated world.
Since they’re only a few years old, they can’t simply
reject their parents and say, “I think I'll go it alone.”
They have to find a way to feel safe and to win their
parents over.

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

Both Horney and Rogers proposed that children
do this by creating or imagining other “selves,”
ones that their parents might like better. These new
selves are what they think the parents are looking
for and what may win them the parents’ acceptance.

Often, these steps are good adjustments to the
family situation at the time, bringing the child some
security and hope.

The problem is that this new self—this all-compe-
tent, strong, good self that they now try to be—is
likely to be a fixed-mindset self. Over time, the fixed
traits may come to be the person's sense of who they
are, and validating these traits may come to be the
main source of their self-esteem.

‘Mindset change asks people to give this up. As you
can imagine, it’s not easy to just let go of something
that has felt like your “self” for many years and that
has given you your route to self-esteem. And it’s es-
pecially not easy to replace it with a mindset that
tells you to embrace all the things that have felt
threatening: challenge, struggle, criticism, setbacks.

When I was exchanging my fixed mindset for a
growth one, I was acutely aware of how unsettled I
felt. For example, I’ve told you how as a fixed mind-

setter, I kept track each day of all my successes. At
the end of a good day, I could look at the results
(the high numbers on my intelligence “counter,”
my personality “counter,” and so on) and feel good
about myself, But as I adopted a growth mindset
and stopped keeping track, some nights I would still
check my mental counters and find them at zero. It
made me insecure not to be able to tote up my victor-
ies.

Even worse, since I was taking more risks, I might
look back over the day and see all the mistakes and
setbacks. And feel miserable.

What's more, it’s not as though the fixed mindset
wants to leave gracefully. If the fixed mindset has
been controlling your internal monologue, it can say
some pretty strong things to you when it sees those
counters at zero: “You're nothing.” It can make you
want to rush right out and rack up some high num-
bers. The fixed mindset once offered you refuge from
that very feeling, and it offers it to you again.

Don't take it.

Then there’s the concern that you won't be your-
self anymore. It may feel as though the fixed mind-
set gave you your ambition, your edge, your indi-

viduality. Maybe you fear you'll become a bland cog
in the wheel just like everyone else. Ordinary.

But opening yourself up to growth makes you more
yourself, not less. The growth-oriented scientists,
artists, athletes, and CEOs we've looked at were far
from humanoids going through the motions. They
were people in the full flower of their individuality
and potency.

OPENING YOURSELF UP TO GROWTH

The rest of the book is pretty much about you. First
are some mindset exercises in which I ask you to
venture with me into a series of dilemmas. In each
case, you'll first see the fixed-mindset reactions, and
then work through to a growth-mindset solution.

The First Dilemma. Imagine you've applied to graduate
school. You applied to just one place because it

was the school you had your heart set on. And

you were confident you'd be accepted since many

‘reste 1 heure et 10 min dans le chapite em%

people considered your work in your field to be
original and exciting. But you were rejected.

The Fixed-Mindset Reaction. At first you tell yourself
that it was extremely competitive, so it doesn’t
really reflect on you. They probably had more
first-rate applicants than they could accept. Then
the voice in your head starts in. It tells you that
you're fooling yourself, rationalizing. It tells
you that the admissions committee found your
work mediocre. After a while, you tell yourself
it’s probably true. The work is probably ordinary,
pedestrian, and they’d seen that. They were
experts. The verdict is in and you're not worthy.
With some effort you talk yourself back into your
first, reasonable, and more flattering conclusion,
and you feel better. In the fixed mindset (and in most
cognitive therapies), that’s the end of it. You've re-
gained your self-esteem, so the job is finished. But
in the growth mindset, that’s just the first step. All
you've done is talk to yourself. Now comes the learn-
ing and self-improvement part.

The Growth-Mindset Step. Think about your
goal and think about what you could do to
stay on track toward achieving it. What steps
could you take to help yourself succeed?
What information could you gather?

Well, maybe you could apply to more schools next
time. Or maybe, in the meantime, you could gather
more information about what makes a good applica-
tion: What are they looking for? What experiences
do they value? You could seek out those experiences
before the next application.

Since this is a true story, I know what step the
rejected applicant took. She was given some strong
growth-mindset advice and, a few days later, she
called the school. When she located the relevant per-
son and told him the situation, she said, “I don’t
want to dispute your decision. I just want to know,
if I decide to apply again in the future, how Ican im-
prove my application. I would be very grateful if you
could give me some feedback along those lines.”

Nobody scoffs at an honest plea for helpful feed-
back. Several days later, he called her back and
offered her admission. It had indeed been a close call

and, after reconsidering her application, the depart-
ment decided they could take one more person that
year. Plus, they liked her initiative.

She had reached out for information that would
allow her to learn from experience and improve in
the future. It turned out in this case that she didn’t
have to improve her application. She got to plunge
right into learning in her new graduate program.

Plans That You'll Carry Out and Ones That You Won't

The key part of our applicant’s reaction was her call
to the school to get more information. It wasn’t easy.
Every day people plan to do difficult things, but they
don’t do them. They think, “I'll do it tomorrow,” and
they swear to themselves that they'll follow through
the next day. Research by Peter Gollwitzer and his
colleagues shows that vowing, even intense vowing,
is often useless. The next day comes and the next
day goes.

What works is making a vivid, concrete plan: “To-
morrow during my break, I'll get a cup of tea, close
the door to my office, and call the graduate school.”
Or, in another case: “On Wednesday morning, right

reste heure et 6 min dans le chapive 89%

after I get up and brush my teeth, I'll sit at my desk
and start writing my report.” Or: “Tonight, right
after the dinner dishes are done, I'll sit down with
my wife in the living room and have that discussion.
T'll say to her, ‘Dear, I'd like to talk about something
that I think will make us happier.’”

Think of something you need to do, something you
want to learn, or a problem you have to confront.
Whatis it? Now make a concrete plan. When will you
follow through on your plan? Where will you do it?
How will you do it? Think about it in vivid detail.

These concrete plans—plans you can visualize—
about when, where, and how you are going to
do something lead to really high levels of follow-
through, which, of course, ups the chances of suc-
cess.

So the idea is not only to make a growth-mindset
plan, but also to visualize, in a concrete way, how
you're going to carry it out.

Feeling Bad, But Doing Good

Let’s go back a few paragraphs to when you were re-
jected by the graduate school. Suppose your attempt

to make yourself feel better had failed. You could still
have taken the growth-mindset step. You can feel mis-
erable and still reach out for information that will
help you improve.

Sometimes after I have a setback, I go through the
process of talking to myself about what it means and
how I plan to deal with it. Everything seems fine—
until I sleep on it. In my sleep, I have dream after
dream of loss, failure, or rejection, depending on
what happened. Once when I'd experienced a loss, I
went to sleep and had the following dreams: My hair
fell out, my teeth fell out, I had a baby and it died,
and so on. Another time when I felt rejected, my
dreams generated countless rejection experiences—
real and imagined. In each instance, the incident
triggered a theme, and my too-active imagination
gathered up all the variations on the theme to place
before me. When I woke up, I felt as though I'd been
through the wars.

It would be nice if this didn’t happen, but it’s ir-
relevant. It might be easier to mobilize for action if 1
felt better, but it doesn’t matter. The plan is the plan.

mindset? The worse they felt, the more they did the

constructive thing. The less they felt like it, the more
they made themselves doit.

The critical thing is to make a concrete, growth-
oriented plan, and to stick to it.

The Number One Draft Choice

The last dilemma seemed hard, but, basically, it was
solved by a phone call. Now imagine you're a prom-
ising quarterback. In fact, you're the winner of the
Heisman trophy, college football’s highest award.
You're the top draft pick of the Philadelphia Eagles,
the team you've always dreamed of playing for. So
what's the dilemma?

The Second Dilemma. The pressure is overwhelming.
You yearn for playing time in the games, but every
time they put you in a game to try you out, you
turn anxious and lose your focus. You were always
cool under pressure, but this is the pros. Now all
you see are giant guys coming toward you—twelve
hundred pounds of giant guys who want to take

you apart. Giant guys who move faster than you
ever thought possible. You feel cornered...helpless.

The Fixed-Mindset Reaction. You torture yourself with
the idea that a quarterback is a leader and you're no
leader. How could you ever inspire the confidence
of your teammates when you can't get your act
together to throw a good pass or scramble for a few
yards? To make things worse, the sportscasters
keep asking, What happened to the boy wonder?

To minimize the humiliation you begin to keep to
yourself and, to avoid the sportscasters, you disap-
pear into the locker room right after the game.

Whoa. Is this a recipe for success? What steps
could you take to make things better? Think about
the resources at your disposal and how you could
use them. But first, get your mindset turned around.

The Growth-Mindset Step. In the growth mindset,
you tell yourself that the switch to the
professionals is a huge step, one that takes a lot
of adjustment and a lot of learning. There are

many things you couldn't possibly know yet
and that you'd better start finding out about.

You try to spend more time with the veteran quar-
terbacks, asking them questions and watching tapes
with them. Instead of hiding your insecurities, you
talk about how different it is from college. They, in
turn, tell you that’s exactly how they felt. In fact,
they share their humiliating stories with you.

You ask them what they did to overcome the ini-
tial difficulties and they teach you their mental and
physical techniques. As you begin to feel more inte-
grated into the team, you realize you're part of an
organization that wants to help you grow, not judge
and belittle you. Rather than worrying that they
overpaid for your talent, you begin to give them
their money’s worth of incredibly hard work and
team spirit.

PEOPLE WHO DON’T WANT TO CHANGE
Entitlement: The World Owes You

Many people with the fixed mindset think the world

needs to change, not them. They feel entitled to
something better—a better job, house, or spouse.
The world should recognize their special qualities
and treat them accordingly. Let’s move to the next
dilemma and imagine yourself in this situation.

The Next Dilemma. “Here | am,” you think, “in this
low-level job. It's demeaning. With my talent I
shouldn’t have to work like this. I should be up
there with the big boys, enjoying the good life.”
Your boss thinks you have a bad attitude. When she
needs someone to take on more responsibilities,
she doesn’t turn to you. When it’s time to give

out promotions, she doesn't include you.

The Fixed-Mindset Reaction. “She's threatened
by me,” you say bitterly. Your fixed mindset
is telling you that, because of who youare,
you should automatically be thrust into the
upper levels of the business. In your mind,
people should see your talents and reward
you. When they don’t, it’s not fair. Why should
you change? You just want your due.
But putting yourself in a growth mindset, what are

some new ways you could think and some steps you
could take? For example, what are some new ways
you could think about effort? About learning? And
how could you act on this new thinking in your
work?

Well, you could consider working harder and being
more helpful to people at work. You could use your
time to learn more about the business you're in in-
stead of bellyaching about your low status. Let’s see
how this might look.

The Growth-Mindset Step. But first, let’s be clear. For
along time, it’s frightening to think of giving up
the idea of being superior. An ordinary, run-of-
the-mill human being isn’t what you want to be.
How could you feel good about yourself if you're no
more valuable than the people you look down on?

You begin to consider the idea that some people
stand out because of their commitment and effort.
Little by little you try putting more effort into things
and seeing if you get more of the rewards you
wanted. You do.

Although you can slowly accept the idea that effort
might be necessary, you still can’t accept that it’s

no guarantee. It’s enough of an indignity to have to
work at things, but to work and still not have them
turn out the way you want—now, that’s really not
fair. That means you could work hard and somebody
else could still get the promotion. Outrageous.

It’s a long time before you begin to enjoy putting
in effort and a long time before you begin to think
in terms of learning. Instead of seeing your time at
the bottom of the corporate ladder as an insult, you
slowly see that you can learn a lot at the bottom
that could help you greatly on your rise to the top.
Learning the nuts and bolts of the company could
later give you a big advantage. All of our top growth-
mindset CEOs knew their companies from top to
bottom, inside out, and upside down.

Instead of seeing your discussions with your col-
leagues as time spent getting what you want, you
begin to grasp the idea of building relationships or
even helping your colleagues develop in ways they
value. This can become a new source of satisfaction.
You might say you were following in the footsteps of
Bill Murray and his Groundhog Day experience.

As you become a more growth-minded person,
you're amazed at how people start to help you, sup-

port you. They no longer seem like adversaries out
to deny you what you deserve. They're more and
more often collaborators toward a common goal. It’s
interesting, you started out wanting to change other
people’s behavior—and you did.

In the end, many people with the fixed mindset
understand that their cloak of specialness was really
a suit of armor they built to feel safe, strong, and
worthy. While it may have protected them early on,
later it constricted their growth, sent them into self-
defeating battles, and cut them off from satisfying,
mutual relationships.

Denial: My Life Is Perfect

People in a fixed mindset often run away from their
problems. If their life is flawed, then they’re flawed.
It's easier to make believe everything's all right. Try
this dilemma.

The Dilemma. You seem to have everything. You have
a fulfilling career, a loving marriage, wonderful
children, and devoted friends. But one of those
things isn't true. Unbeknownst to you, your

marriage is ending. It’s not that there haven’t
been signs, but you chose to misinterpret them.
You were fulfilling your idea of the “man’s role”
or the “womans role,” and couldn’t hear your
partner's desire for more communication and
more sharing of your lives. By the time you wake
up and take notice, it’s too late. Your spouse has
disengaged emotionally from the relationship.

The Fixed-Mindset Reaction. You've always felt
sorry for divorced people, abandoned people.
And now you're one of them. You lose all
sense of worth. Your partner, who knew you
intimately, doesn’t want you anymore.

For months, you don’t feel like going on, convinced
that even your children would be better off without
you. It takes you a while to get to the point where
you feel at all useful or competent. Or hopeful. Now
comes the hard part because, even though you now
feel a little better about yourself, you're still in the
fixed mindset. You’re embarking on a lifetime of
judging. With everything good that happens, your
internal voice says, Maybe I’m okay after all. But
with everything bad that happens, the voice says,

My spouse was right. Every new person you meet is
judged too—as a potential betrayer.

How could you rethink your marriage, yourself,
and your life from a growth-mindset perspective?
Why were you afraid to listen to your spouse? What
could you have done? What should you do now?

The Growth-Mindset Step. First, it’s not that

the marriage, which you used to think of as
inherently good, suddenly turned out to have
been all bad or always bad. It was an evolving
thing that had stopped developing for lack of
nourishment. You need to think about how both
you and your spouse contributed to this, and
especially about why you weren't able to hear
the request for greater closeness and sharing.

‘As you probe, you realize that, in your fixed mind-
set, you saw your partner’s request as a criticism of
you that you didn’t want to hear. You also realize
that at some level, you were afraid you weren't cap-
able of the intimacy your partner was requesting. So
instead of exploring these issues with your spouse,
you turned a deaf ear, hoping they would go away.

CHANGING YOUR CHILD'S MINDSET

Many of our children, our most precious resource,
are stuck in a fixed mindset. You can give them a per-
sonal Brainology workshop. Let’s look at some ways
to do this.

The Precocious Fixed Mindsetter

Most kids who adopt a fixed mindset don’t become
truly passionate believers until later in childhood.

But some kids take to it much earlier.

The Dilemma. Imagine your young son comes home
from school one day and says to you, “Some kids are
smart and some kids are dumb. They have a worse
brain.” You're appalled. “Who told you that?” you
ask him, gearing up to complain to the school. “I
figured it out myself,” he says proudly. He saw that
some children could read and write their letters
and add a lot of numbers, and others couldn't.

He drew his conclusion. And he held fast to it.

Your son is precocious in all aspects of the fixed
mindset, and soon the mindset is in full flower. He
develops a distaste for effort—he wants his smart
brain to churn things out quickly for him. And it
often does.

When he takes to chess very quickly, your spouse,
thinking to inspire him, rents the movie Searching
for Bobby Fischer, a film about a young chess cham-
pion. What your son learns from the film is that you
could lose and not be a champion anymore. So he re-
tires. “I’m a chess champion,” he announces to one
andall. A champion who won't play.

Because he now understands what losing means,
he takes further steps to avoid it. He starts cheat-
ing at Candy Land, Chutes and Ladders, and other
games.

He talks often about all the things he can do and
other children can’t. When you and your spouse
tell him that other children aren’t dumb, they just
haven't practiced as much as he has, he refuses
to believe it. He watches things carefully at school
and then comes home and reports, “Even when the
teacher shows us something new, I can do it better
than them. I don’t have to practice.”

This boy is invested in his brain—not in making it
grow but in singing its praises. You've already told
him that it’s about practice and learning, not smart
and dumb, but he doesn’t buy it. What else can you
do? What are other ways you can get the message
across?

The Growth-Mindset Step. You decide that, rather
than trying to talk him out of the fixed mindset,
you have to live the growth mindset. At the dinner
table each evening, you and your partner structure
the discussion around the growth mindset,

asking each child (and each other): “What did

you learn today?” “What mistake did you make
that taught you something?” “What did you try
hard at today?” You go around the table with each
question, excitedly discussing your own and one
another's effort, strategies, setbacks, and learning.

You talk about skills you have today that you didn’t
have yesterday because of the practice you put in.
You dramatize mistakes you made that held the key
to the solution, telling it like a mystery story. You de-
scribe with relish things you're struggling with and
making progress on. Soon the children can’t wait
each night to tell their stories. “Oh my goodness,”
you say with wonder, “you certainly did get smarter
today!”

When your fixed-mindset son tells stories about
doing things better than other children, everyone
says, “Yeah, but what did you learn?” When he talks
about how easy everything is for him in school, you
all say, “Oh, that’s too bad. You're not learning. Can
you find something harder to do so you could learn
more?” When he boasts about being a champ, you
say, “Champs are the people who work the hardest.
You can become a champ. Tomorrow tell me some-

thing you've done to become a champ.” Poor kid,
it’s a conspiracy. In the long run, he doesn’t stand a
chance.

When he does his homework and calls it easy or
boring, you teach him to find ways to make it more
fun and challenging. If he has to write words, like
boy, youask him, “How many words can you think of
that rhyme with boy? Write them on separate paper
and later we can try to make a sentence that has
all the words.” When he finishes his homework, you
play that game: “The boy threw the toy into the soy
sauce.” “The girl with the cirl [curl] ate a pirl [pearl].”
Eventually, he starts coming up with his own ways
to make his homework more challenging.

And it’s not just school or sports. You encourage
the children to talk about ways they learned to make
friends, or ways they’re learning to understand and
help others. You want to communicate that feats
of intellect or physical prowess are not all you care
about.

For a long time, your son remains attracted to the
fixed mindset. He loves the idea that he’s inherently
special—case closed. He doesn’t love the idea that he
has to work every day for some little gain in skill

or knowledge. Stardom shouldn't be so taxing. Yet
as the value system in the family shifts toward the
growth mindset, he wants to be a player. So at first
he talks the talk (squawking), then he walks the walk
(balking). Finally, going all the way, he becomes the
mindset watchdog. When anyone in the family slips
into fixed-mindset thinking, he delights in catching
them. “Be careful what you wish for,” you joke to
your spouse.

The fixed mindset is so very tempting. It seems to
promise children a lifetime of worth, success, and
admiration just for sitting there and being who they
are. That’s why it can take a lot of work to make the
growth mindset flourish where the fixed mindset
has taken root.

Effort Gone Awry

Sometimes the problem with a child isn’t too little
effort. It’s too much. And for the wrong cause. We've

midnight every night studying. Or children who are

ally not in a growth mindset. They're not focused
on love of learning. They’re usually trying to prove
themselves to their parents.

And in some cases, the parents may like what
comes out of this high effort: the grades, the awards,
the admission to top schools. Let’s see how you
would handle this one.

The Dilemma. You're proud of your daughter. She's
at the top of her class and bringing home straight
A’s. She’s a flute player studying with the best
teacher in the country. And you're confident she'll
get into the top private high school in the city. But
every morning before school, she gets an upset
stomach, and some days she throws up. You keep
feeding her a blander and blander diet to soothe

her sensitive stomach, but it doesn’t help. It never
occurs to you that she’s a nervous wreck.

When your daughter is diagnosed with an ulcer, it
should be a wake-up call, but you and your spouse
remain asleep. You continue to see it as a gastro-
intestinal issue. The doctor, however, insists that
you consult a family counselor. He tells you it’s a
mandatory part of your daughter's treatment and

hands you a card with the counselor's name and
number.

The Fixed-Mindset Reactions. The counselor tells you to
ease up on your daughter: Let her know it’s okay not
to work so hard. Make sure she gets more sleep. So
you, dutifully following the instructions, make sure
she gets to sleep by ten o'clock each night. But this
only makes things worse. She now has less time to
accomplish all the things that are expected of her.
Despite what the counselor has said, it doesn’t
occur to you that she could possibly want your
daughter to fall behind other students. Or be less ac-
complished at the flute. Or risk not getting into the
top high school. How could that be good for her?
The counselor realizes she has a big job. Her first
goal is to get you more fully in touch with the ser-
iousness of the problem. The second goal is to get
you to understand your role in the problem. You and
your spouse need to see that it’s your need for per-
fection that has led to the problem. Your daughter
wouldn't have run herself ragged if she hadn’t been
afraid of losing your approval. The third goal is to
work out a concrete plan that you can all follow.

Can you think of some concrete things that can be
done to help your daughter enter a growth mindset
so she can ease up and get some pleasure from her
life?

The Growth-Mindset Step. The plan the counselor
suggests would allow your daughter to start
enjoying the things she does. The flute lessons
are put on hold. Your daughter is told she can
practice as much or as little as she wants for
the pure joy of the music and nothing else.

She is to study her school materials to learn from
them, not to cram everything possible into her head.
The counselor refers her to a tutor who teaches her
how to study for understanding. The tutor also dis-
cusses the material with her in a way that makes it
interesting and enjoyable. Studying now has a new
meaning. It isn’t about getting the highest grade to
prove her intelligence and worth to her parents. It’s
about learning things and thinking about them in
interesting ways.

Your daughter's teachers are brought into the loop
to support her in her reorientation toward growth.
They're asked to talk to her about (and praise her

for) her learning process rather than how she did on
tests. (“I can see that you really understand how to
use metaphors in your writing.” “I can see that you
were really into your project on the Incas. When I
read it, I felt as though I were in ancient Peru.”) You
are taught to talk to her this way too.

Finally, the counselor strongly urges that your
daughter attend a high school that is less pressured
than the one you have your eye on. There are other
fine schools that focus more on learning and less
on grades and test scores. You take your daughter
around and spend time in each of the schools. Then
she discusses with you and the counselor which
ones she was most excited about and felt most at
ease in.

Slowly, you learn to separate your needs and de-
sires from hers. You may have needed a daugh-
ter who was number one in everything, but your
daughter needed something else: acceptance from
her parents and freedom to grow. As you let go, your
daughter becomes much more genuinely involved in
the things she does. She does them for interest and
learning, and she does them very well indeed.

Is your child trying to tell you something you don't
want to hear? You know the ad that asks, “Do you

what your child is trying to tell you—in words or
actions—then you don't know where your child is.
Enter the growth mindset and listen harder.

MINDSET AND WILLPOWER

Sometimes we don’t want to change ourselves very
much. We just want to be able to drop some pounds
and keep them off. Or stop smoking. Or control our
anger.

Some people think about this in a fixed-mindset
way. If you're strong and have willpower, you can do
it. But if you’re weak and don’t have willpower, you
can’t. People who think this way may firmly resolve
to do something, but they’ll take no special meas-
ures to make sure they succeed. These are the people
who end up saying, “Quitting is easy. I’ve done it a
hundred times.”

It's just like the chemistry students we talked
about before. The ones with the fixed-mindset

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

thought: I have ability, I'll do well; if I don’t,
I won't.” As a result, they didn’t use sophisticated
strategies to help themselves. They just studied in an
earnest but superficial way and hoped for the best.

When people with a fixed mindset fail their test—
in chemistry, dieting, smoking, or anger—they beat
themselves up. They’re incompetent, weak, or bad
people. Where do you go from there?

My friend Nathan's twenty-fifth high school re-
union was coming up, and when he thought about
how his ex-girlfriend would be there, he decided to
lose the paunch. He'd been handsome and fit in high
school and he didn’t want to show up asa fat middle-
aged man.

Nathan had always made fun of women and their
diets. What’s the big fuss? You just need some self-
control. To lose the weight, he decided he would just
eat part of what was on his plate. But each time he
got into a meal, the food on the plate disappeared. “I
blew it!” he'd say, feeling like a failure and ordering
dessert—either to seal the failure or to lift his mood.

I'd say, “Nathan, this isn’t working. You need a bet-
ter system. Why not put some of the meal aside at
the beginning or have the restaurant wrap it up to

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

take home? Why not fill your plate with extra vege-
tables, so it’ll look like more food? There are lots of
things you can do.” To this he would say, “No, I have
to be strong.”

Nathan ended up going on one of those liquid
crash diets, losing weight for the reunion, and put-
ting back more than he lost afterward. I wasn’t sure
how this was being strong, and how using some sim-
ple strategies was being weak.

Next time you try to diet, think of Nathan and re-
member that willpower is not just a thing you have
or don’t have. Willpower needs help. I'll come back
to this point.

Anger

Controlling anger is something else that’s a problem
for many people. Something triggers their temper
and off they go, losing control of their mouths or
worse. Here, too, people may vow that next time
they'll be different. Anger control is a big issue be-
tween partners and between parents and children,
not only because partners and children do things
that make us angry, but also because we may think

we have a greater right to let loose when they do. Try
this one.

The Dilemma. Imagine you're a nice, caring person—
as you probably are—usually. You love your spouse
and feel lucky to have them as your partner. But
when they violate one of your rules, like letting

the garbage overflow before taking it out, you feel
personally betrayed and start criticizing. It begins
with “I’ve told you a thousand times,” then moves
on to “You never do anything right.” When they still
don’t seem properly ashamed, you flare, insulting
their intelligence (“Maybe you aren’t smart enough
to remember garbage”) and their character (“If you
weren't so irresponsible, you wouldn't...” “If you
cared about anyone but yourself, you'd...”). Seething
with rage, you then bring in everything you can
think of to support your case: “My father never
trusted you, either,” or “Your boss was right when he
said you were limited.” Your spouse has to leave the
premises to get out of range of your mounting fury.

The Fixed-Mindset Reaction. You feel righteous about
your anger for a while, but then you realize you've

gone too far. You suddenly recall all the ways

that your spouse is a supportive partner and feel
intensely guilty. Then you talk yourself back into
the idea that you, too, are a good person, who's just
slipped up—tost it—temporarily. “I've really learned
my lesson,” you think. “I'll never do this again.”

But believing you can simply keep that good per-
son in the forefront in the future, you don’t think of
strategies you could use next time to prevent a flare-
up. That's why the next time is a carbon copy of the
time before.

The Growth Mindset and Self-Control

Some people think about losing weight or con-
trolling their anger in a growth-mindset way. They
realize that to succeed, they'll need to learn and
practice strategies that work for them.

It’s like the growth-mindset chemistry stu-
dents. They used better study techniques, carefully
planned their study time, and kept up their motiv-
ation. In other words, they used every strategy pos-
sible to make sure they succeeded.

Just like them, people in a growth mindset don't
merely make New Year's resolutions and wait to see
if they stick to them. They understand that to diet,
they need to plan. They may need to keep desserts
out of the house. Or think in advance about what
to order in restaurants. Or schedule a once-a-week
splurge. Or consider exercising more.

They think actively about maintenance. What
habits must they develop to continue the gains
they've achieved?

Then there are the setbacks, They know that set-
backs will happen. So instead of beating themselves
up, they ask: “What can I learn from this? What will
I do next time when I’m in this situation?” It’s a
learning process—not a battle between the bad you
and the good you.

In that last episode, what could you have done
with your anger? First, think about why you got so
worked up. You may have felt devalued and disres-
pected when your spouse shirked the tasks or broke
your rules—as though they were saying to you,
“You're not important. Your needs are trivial. I can’t
be bothered.”

Your first reaction was to angrily remind them of
their duty. But on the heels of that was your retali-
ation, sort of “Okay big shot, if you think you're so
important, try this on for size.”

Your spouse, rather than reassuring you of your
importance, simply braced for the onslaught. Mean-
while, you took the silence as evidence that they felt
superior, and it fueled your escalation.

What can be done? Several things. First, spouses
can’t read your mind, so when an anger-provok-
ing situation arises, you have to matter-of-factly tell
them how it makes you feel. “I’m not sure why, but
when you do that, it makes me feel unimportant.
Like you can’t be bothered to do things that matter
tome.”

They, in turn, can reassure you that they care about
how you feel and will try to be more watchful. (“Are
you kidding?” you say. “My spouse would never do
that.” Well, you can request it directly, as I've some-
times done: “Please tell me that you care how I feel
and you'll try to be more watchful.”)

When you feel yourself losing it, you can learn
to leave the room and write down your ugliest
thoughts, followed by what is probably really hap-

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

pening (“She doesn’t understand this is important to
me,” “He doesn’t know what to do when I start to
blow”). When you feel calm enough, you can return
to the situation.

You can also learn to loosen up on some of your
rules, now that each one is not a test of your part-
ner’s respect for you. With time, you might even
gain a sense of humor about them. For example, if
your spouse leaves some socks in the living room
or puts the wrong things in the recycling bins, you
might point at the offending items and ask sternly,
“What is the meaning of this?” You might even have
agood laugh.

When people drop the good-bad, strong-weak
thinking that grows out of the fixed mindset, they're
better able to learn useful strategies that help with
self-control. Every lapse doesn’t spell doom. It’s like
anything else in the growth mindset. It’s a reminder
that you're an unfinished human being and a clue to
how to do it better next time.

MAINTAINING CHANGE

Whether people change their mindset in order to
further their career, heal from a loss, help their
children thrive, lose weight, or control their anger,
change needs to be maintained. It’s amazing—once
a problem improves, people often stop doing what
caused it to improve. Once you feel better, you stop
taking your medicine.

But change doesn’t work that way. When you've
lost weight, the issue doesn’t go away. Or when your
child starts to love learning, the problem isn’t solved
forever. Or when you and your partner start com-
municating better, that’s not the end of it. These
changes have to be supported or they can go away
faster than they appeared.

Maybe that’s why Alcoholics Anonymous tells
people they will always be alcoholics—so they won't
become complacent and stop doing what they need
to do to stay sober. It’s a way of saying, “You'll always
be vulnerable.”

This is why mindset change is not about picking
up a few tricks. In fact, if someone stays inside a
fixed mindset and uses the growth strategies, it can
backfire.

Wes, a dad with a fixed mindset, was at his wit’s
end. He’d come home exhausted from work every
evening and his son, Mickey, would refuse to cooper-
ate. Wes wanted quiet, but Mickey was noisy. Wes
would warn him, but Mickey would continue what
he was doing. Wes found him stubborn, unruly, and
not respectful of Wes's rights as a father. The whole
scene would disintegrate into a shouting match and
Mickey would end up being punished.

Finally, feeling he had nothing to lose, Wes tried
some of the growth-oriented strategies. He showed
respect for Mickey’s efforts and praised his strategies
when he was empathic or helpful. The turnaround
in Mickey’s behavior was dramatic.

But as soon as the turnaround took place, Wes
stopped using the strategies. He had what he wanted
and he expected it to just continue. When it didn’t,
he became even angrier and more punitive than be-
fore. Mickey had shown he could behave and now re-
fused to.

The same thing often happens with fixed-mindset
couples who start communicating better. Marlene
and Scott were what my husband and I call the Bick-
ersons. All they did was bicker: “Why don’t you ever
pick up after yourself?” “I might if you weren't such
a nag.” “I wouldn't have to nag if you did what you
were supposed to do.” “Who made you the judge of
what /’m supposed to do?”

With counseling, Marlene and Scott stopped jump-
ing on the negatives. More and more, they started re-
warding the thoughtful things their partner did and
the efforts their partner made. The love and tender-
ness they thought were dead returned. But once it
returned, they reverted. In the fixed mindset, things
shouldn't need such effort. Good people should just
act good and good relationships should just unfold
ina good way.

When the bickering resumed, it was fiercer than
ever because it reflected all of their disappointed
hopes.

Mindset change is not about picking up a few
pointers here and there. It’s about seeing things ina
new way. When people—couples, coaches and ath-
letes, managers and workers, parents and children,

teachers and students—change to a growth mindset,
they change from a judge-and-be-judged framework
to a learn-and-help-learn framework. Their commit-
ment is to growth, and growth takes plenty of time,
effort, and mutual support to achieve and maintain.

THE JOURNEY TO A (TRUE) GROWTH MINDSET

In chapter 7, I talked about the “false growth mind-
set.” If you remember, my colleague Susan Mackie
was encountering people who claimed to have a
growth mindset but who, upon closer inspection,
did not. Once alerted, I started seeing false growth
mindset everywhere and I understood why it was
happening. Everyone wants to seem enlightened, in
the know. Maybe as a parent, educator, coach, or
business professional, having a growth mindset was
expected or admired.

Or maybe it was my fault. Did I make the change
to a growth mindset seem too easy, so that people
didn’t realize that a journey was required? Or maybe
people didn’t know how to take the journey. So let’s
talk more about that journey.

MINDSET: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY OF SUCC..

The Journey: Step 1

You'll be surprised to hear me say this. The first step is
to embrace your fixed mindset. Let’s face it, we all have
some of it. We're all a mixture of growth and fixed
mindsets and we need to acknowledge that. It’s not
a shameful admission. It’s more like, welcome to the
human race. But even though we have to accept that
some fixed mindset dwells within, we do not have to
accept how often it shows up and how much havoc it
can wreak when it does.

The Journey: Step 2

The second step is to become aware of your fixed-
mindset triggers. When does your fixed-mindset
“persona” come home to roost?

«It could be when you're thinking about
taking ona big, new challenge. Your fixed-
mindset persona might appear and whisper,
“Maybe you don’t have what it takes, and
everyone will find out.”

«It could be when you're struggling with
something and you keep hitting dead ends.
Your fixed-mindset persona might fly in and
offer its advice: “Give it up. It’s just making
you feel frustrated and ashamed. Do some-
thing easier.”

How about when you feel like you've failed
decisively? Lost your job. Lost a cherished
relationship. Messed up in a very big way.
It’s arare person who doesn’t have a fixed-
mindset episode. And we all know very well
what that fixed mindset says to us: “You're
not the person you thought you were—and
you never will be.”

- What about when you encounter someone
who's a lot better than you in the very area
you pride yourself on? What does that fixed-
mindset voice say to you? Does it tell you
that you'll never be as good? Does it make
you hate that person just a little?

+ What about our fixed mindset toward
others? If we're educators, what happens
after a high-stakes test? Do we judge who's

smart and who isn't? If we're managers,
what happens during and after a big pro-
ject? Do we judge our employees’ talent? If
we're parents, do we pressure our kids to
prove they’re smarter than others and make
them feel judged based on their grades and
test scores?

Think about it. What's a recent time you were trig-
gered into a fixed mindset? What happened to sum-
mon your fixed-mindset persona? What did it whis-
per in your ear, and how did it make you feel?

When I asked people to tell me when their fixed-
mindset persona usually shows up, here's what they
said:

“When I'm under pressure, my fixed-mind-
set persona appears. He fills my head with
noise and keeps me from paying attention to
the work I have to do. Then I feel like I can’t
accomplish anything. Feelings of anxiety
and sadness also attract him. He attempts to
weaken me when I’m already feeling down.
He makes comments like ‘You don’t have the

ability to grasp difficult concepts. You have
reached your limit.” (By the way, this was
a woman who thought of her fixed-mindset
persona as a male.)

“Whenever I demonstrate my laziness
through procrastination, whenever I have a
disagreement with someone, whenever I'm
too shy to talk to anyone at a party, my
fixed mindset persona shows up....He tells
me, ‘Your FAILURE doesn’t define you’ Of
course, he yells the word ‘failure’ and whis-
pers the rest.”

“Whenever I fail to live up to the image that
she—my fixed-mindset persona—concocted
for me, she makes me feel stressed, defen-
sive, and unmotivated. She doesn’t allow me
to take risks that may affect our reputation
as a successful person. She doesn’t let me
speak out for fear of being wrong. She forces
me to look like a person who can understand
and do everything effortlessly.”

“When we have a work deadline and my
team is under the gun, my fixed-mindset
persona sits in judgment. Instead of em-
powering my team, I become a harping per-
fectionist—no one is doing it right, no one
is working fast enough. Where are all those
breakthrough ideas? We'll never make it. As
a result, I often just take over and do a lot of
the work myself. Needless to say, it doesn’t
do wonders for team morale.” (We will hear
more from this team leader and one of his
© team members in a moment.)

As you come to understand your triggers and get to
know your persona, don’t judge it. Just observe it.

The Journey: Step 3

Now give your fixed-mindset persona a name.

You heard me correctly.

I watched as Susan Mackie worked with financial
executives who had given their fixed-mindset perso-
nas names. They were talking about what triggers
their personas, and the top guy said, “When we're

in a crunch, Duane shows up. He makes me super-
critical of everyone, and I get bossy and demand-
ing rather than supportive.” A female team mem-
ber quickly responded: “Yes, and when your Duane
shows up, my Ianni comes roaring out. Ianni is the
macho guy who makes me feel incompetent. So your
Duane brings out my Ianni and I become cowering
and anxious, which infuriates Duane.” And on went
this amazing conversation. These sophisticated pro-
fessionals talked about when their named persona
showed up, how it made them feel and act, and how
it affected others around them. By the way, once
they were able to understand each other's triggers
and personas, they could move their interactions to
another level and the morale in this unit went up by
leaps and bounds.

Every fall I teach a freshman seminar—sixteen
brand-new Stanford students, very eager and very
nervous. Each week I give them a different as-

future and write me a letter about where you are
in your life and all the struggles, disappointments,
hardships, and failures you've encountered along
the way.

This year I tried a new one. In the past, I had as-
signed a paper that asked students to reflect on their
mindsets, and I’d always had a few of them laying
claim to a long-standing and total growth mindset.
But this year I asked them to identify their fixed-
mindset triggers and to give their fixed-mindset per-
sona a name. It was fascinating. Not one student
claimed to have no triggers or persona. All of them
were able to write eloquently (and painfully) about
their fixed-mindset persona, its triggers, and its im-
pact.

“Meet Gertrude, my cagey, histrionic, self-
aggrandizing fixed-mindset persona. She
sneaks into my subconscious and under-
mines me. The name Gertrude means
‘strong spear, which reflects her insistence
on unwavering, natural strength. She de-

Henrietta comes out. She is my critical

when an endeavor veers in the wrong direc-

Take a moment to think carefully about your own
fixed-mindset persona. Will you name it after some-
one in your life? A character from a book or a movie?
Will you give it your middle name—it’s part of you
but not the main part of you? Or perhaps you might
give it a name you don't like, to remind you that
that’s not the person you want to be.

The Journey: Step 4

You're in touch with your triggers and you're excru-
ciatingly aware of your fixed-mindset persona and
what it does to you. It has a name. What happens
now? Educate it. Take it on the journey with you.
The more you become aware of your fixed-mindset
triggers, the more you can be on the lookout for the
arrival of your persona. If you're on the verge of step-

ping out of your comfort zone, be ready to greet it
when it shows up and warns you to stop. Thank it
for its input, but then tell it why you want to take
this step and ask it to come along with you: “Look,
I know this may not work out, but I'd really like to
take a stab at it. Can I count on you to bear with me?”

When you hit a setback, the chances are excellent
it’s going to show up again. Don’t suppress it or ban
it. Just let it do its thing. Let it do its song and dance,
and when it settles down a bit, talk to it about how
you plan to learn from the setback and go forward:
“Yes, yes, it’s possible that I’m not so good at this
(yet), but I think I have an idea of what to do next.
Let’s just try it.”

When you're under pressure and you're afraid your
team will let you down, tell them that Duane is in
full bloom and ask them what they need from you
to do their best work. Try to understand and respect
where they are and what they’re thinking, and try to
support and guide them. Keep talking to Duane so he
can calm down—and then help you cut them some
slack and contribute to team process.

Remember that your fixed-mindset persona was
born to protect you and keep you safe. But it has

developed some very limiting ways of doing that. So
educate it in the new growth mindset ways that it
can support you: in taking on challenges and stick-
ing to them, bouncing back from failure, and help-
ing and supporting others to grow. Understand the
persona’s point of view, but slowly teach it a differ-
ent way of thinking, and take it with you on your
journey to a growth mindset.

Understanding that everyone has a fixed-mindset
persona can give us more compassion for people. It
allows us to understand their struggles. I mentioned
in a previous chapter how upset I was to learn that
some educators were scolding children for acting in
fixed-mindset ways. They would point to the mind-
set chart in the front of the room and tell the kids to
shape up.

Compare this to the following teacher. Over a
period of time, this teacher had her grade school
class talk about their fixed-mindset triggers and
then give their personas a name. One boy wouldn’t
do it, which was very much in line with a lot of his
behavior. There were many things he wouldn't do
no matter how much the teacher gently encouraged
him. For weeks he sat there mute while every other

student in the class talked about and drew pictures
of their little fixed-mindset personas—Scared Sally,
Lazy Larry, Anxious Andy, or Helpless Hannah. But
the teacher let him know that she was there for him
whenever he was ready, and one day, out of nowhere,
he said, “Dumping Dan.” “What?” the teacher asked.
“Dumping Dan,” he repeated. “Whenever I do some-
thing, I do it wrong. I can’t do anything right. That's
why everyone dumps on me.” Whenever he tried
to do his schoolwork, it seemed that Dumping Dan
would yell at him so loudly that he couldn't proceed.
The teacher rushed to his side and worked with him
and Dumping Dan so that eventually Dan relented,
gave him some peace, and allowed him to work.
After that, his growth was tremendous.

How many students or employees are considered
incompetent, stubborn, or defiant when they just
don’t know how to function well under the cur-
rent conditions? How often do we threaten, punish,
or write off these people rather than helping them
work it through or helping them find the conditions
under which they can thrive?

Every one of us has a journey to take.

«It starts by accepting that we all have both
mindsets.

- Then we learn to recognize what triggers
our fixed mindset. Failures? Criticism?
Deadlines? Disagreements?

- And we come to understand what happens
to us when our fixed-mindset “persona” is
triggered. Who is this persona? What's its
name? What does it make us think, feel, and
do? How does it affect those around us?

«Importantly, we can gradually learn to
remain in a growth-mindset place despite
the triggers, as we educate our persona and
invite it to join us on our growth-mindset
journey.

+ Ideally, we will learn more and more about
how we can help others on their journey,
too.

LEARN AND HELP LEARN

Let's say you've named and tamed your fixed-mind-
set persona. That's great, but please don’t think your
journey is complete. For your growth mindset to
bear fruit, you need to keep setting goals—goals for
growth. Every day presents you with ways to grow
and to help the people you care about grow. How can
you remember to look for these chances?

First, make a copy of this graphic summary of the
two mindsets, which was created by the wonder-
ful Nigel Holmes, and tape it to your mirror. Each
morning, use it to remind yourself of the differences
between the fixed and growth mindsets. Then, as
you contemplate the day in front of you, try to ask
yourself these questions. If you have room on your
mirror, copy them over and tape them there, too.

What are the opportunities for learning and
growth today? For myself? For the people
around me?

As you think of opportunities, form a plan, and ask:

When, where, and how will I embark on my
plan?

When, where, and how make the plan concrete. How
asks you to think of all the ways to bring your plan to
life and make it work.

As you encounter the inevitable obstacles and set-
backs, form anew plan and ask yourself the question
again:

When, where, and how will I act on my new
plan?

Regardless of how bad you may feel, chat with your
fixed-mindset persona and then doit!

And when you succeed, don’t forget to ask your-
self:

What do Ihave to do to maintain and continue
the growth?

Remember, as Alex Rodriguez, the baseball player,
wisely said: “You either go one way or the other.” You
might as well be the one deciding the direction.

THE ROAD AHEAD

Change can be tough, but I've never heard anyone
say it wasn’t worth it. Maybe they're just rationaliz-
ing, the way people who've gone through a painful
initiation say it was worth it. But people who've
changed can tell you how their lives have been en-
hanced. They can tell you about things they have
now that they wouldn't have had, and ways they feel
now that they wouldn’t have felt.

Did changing toward a growth mindset solve all
my problems? No. But I know that I have a different

life because of it—a richer one. And that I’m a more
alive, courageous, and open person because of it.

It’s for you to decide whether change is right for
you now. Maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. But either way,
keep the growth mindset in your thoughts. Then,
when you bump up against obstacles, you can turn
to it. It will always be there for you, showing you a
path into the future.

CHAPTER 8. CHANGING MINDSETS.

In the 1960s, psychiatrist Aaron Beck: Aaron T. Beck,
“Thinking and Depression: Idiosyncratic Content
and Cognitive Distortions,” Archives of General
Psychology 9 (1963), 325-333; Prisoners of Hate:

The Cognitive Basis of Anger, Hostility, and Violence
(New York: HarperCollins, 1999). (At about the same
time, therapist Albert Ellis was discovering a similar
thing: that beliefs are the key to how people feel.)

In several studies, we probed: This work was done with
Ying-yi Hong, C. Y. Chiu, and Russell Sacks.

It does not confront the basic: However, see Jeffrey E.
Young and Janet Klosko, Reinventing Your Life (New
York: Plume/Penguin, 1994). Although Young and
Klosko are working in a cognitive therapy tradition,
a core assumption of their approach and one that
they teach their clients is that people can change in
very basic ways.

A Mindset Workshop: This workshop was developed
with Lisa Sorich Blackwell with grants from the
William T. Grant Foundation and the Spencer
Foundation: L. S. Blackwell, C. S. Dweck, and K.
Trzesniewski, Implicit Theories of Intelligence Predict

on the growth mindset: Jeff Howard, founder of the
Efficacy Institute, and Joshua Aronson, Catherine
Good, and Michael Inzlicht of New York University
and Columbia University.

“Many people think of the brain”: This was written for
the workshop by Lisa Sorich Blackwell.

Brainology: The Brainology computer-based program
was also developed with Lisa Sorich Blackwell, with
agrant from the William T. Grant Foundation.
